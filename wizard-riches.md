## How The Advantage Works

Wizard Riches has **multiple advantage opportunities** (complicated but lucrative):

**Four Advantage Types:**
1. Delayed Wilds (purple border symbols)
2. Countdown Jackpots (icons at top)
3. Past Mystery Multipliers (left bookcase)
4. Future Mystery Multipliers (right bookcase)

---

## PLAY WHEN

### 1. DELAYED WILDS (Low Variance)

Purple-bordered symbols turn WILD next spin. Don't appear in reel 1. Play **1 spin only**.

| Pattern | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| 2 connected | Anywhere in first 4 reels (left-to-right) |
| 3 total | Anywhere in first 3 reels |
| 4 total | Anywhere in first 4 reels |

---

### 2. COUNTDOWN JACKPOTS (High Variance)

Jackpot icons at top of reels with yellow countdown indicators.
- 0 yellow indicators = Disappears next spin
- 3 adjacent = Mini | 4 adjacent = Minor | 5 adjacent = Major

**Play when:**
- <strong>2</strong> jackpot icons with yellow indicators remaining
- Adjacent reels OR one reel gap between them

---

### 3. LEFT BOOKCASE — Past Multipliers (High Variance)

Last 5 wins displayed. Multiplier (2x-10x) can apply to one of them.

**Play when:**
| Shelf Position | Minimum Win Size |
|----------------|------------------|
| Top (most recent) | <strong>4x</strong> bet |
| Middle | <strong>6x</strong> bet |
| Bottom | <strong>8x</strong> bet |

**Tip:** Touch left bookcase to illuminate last 5 wins.

---

### 4. RIGHT BOOKCASE — Future Multipliers (High Variance)

Multiplier (2x-10x) applies to next 1-5 wins.

**Play when:**
- Multiplier <strong>4x+</strong>
- AND at least 1 empty shelf inside purple border

**DO NOT play if:**
- Says "Next Win" with number already highlighted in purple

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Delayed wilds only in reel 1 (don't appear there)
- Countdown jackpots with 0 indicators (disappear next spin)
- Right bookcase multiplier with full shelves inside purple border
- "Next Win" already highlighted

---

## STOP WHEN

- Delayed wilds trigger (1 spin only)
- Multiplier applies to a win
- Jackpot won

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Playing delayed wilds for more than 1 spin
- Not recognizing yellow countdown indicators
- Playing right bookcase when shelves are full
- Ignoring left bookcase (touch to illuminate)

---

## Additional Notes

**Good Hustle Game:**
- Confusing nature = Many overlooked plays
- No free games bonus → More payback in advantage features

**Multiplier Notes:**
- Mystery multipliers do NOT apply to jackpots
- Last wins do NOT include jackpot or multiplier wins

**Variance:**
- Delayed wilds: Low variance
- Countdown jackpots: High variance
- Mystery multipliers: High variance
