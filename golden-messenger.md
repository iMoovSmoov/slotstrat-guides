## How The Advantage Works

Golden Messenger features **coin collection with prize pick**:

**Mechanic:**
- Collect <strong>3</strong> coins above a reel → Choose prize from 3 options
- Reel also turns wild for <strong>1</strong> spin (only 1 spin, not 3)

**Prize Types (by reel color):**
| Reel Color | Prize Type |
|------------|------------|
| Green | Credit prize pick |
| Blue | Free games pick |
| Red | Jackpot prize pick |

---

## ⚠️ HIGH VARIANCE WARNING

**Pick is volatile:**
- Usually 1 good option + 2 bad options
- Log many sessions to even out picks

---

## PLAY WHEN (ANY ONE)

**Important:** Do NOT count reels already at 3 coins (coins removed next spin).

**Option A — Three Reels Setup:**
- <strong>3</strong> reels each with <strong>2</strong> coins

**Option B — First 3 Reels:**
- <strong>5+</strong> coins in first 3 reels

**Option C — Any Reels:**
- <strong>7+</strong> coins anywhere

| Coin Setup | Action |
|------------|--------|
| 3 reels with 2 coins each | ✅ **Play** |
| 5+ coins in reels 1-3 | ✅ **Play** |
| 7+ coins anywhere | ✅ **Play** |
| Reel already at 3 coins | ❌ Don't count (resets) |

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Fewer than required coins for setup type
- Only counting reels already at 3 coins

---

## STOP WHEN

- Prize pick completes

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Counting reels with 3 coins (they reset next spin)
- Expecting every play to profit (volatile—need many sessions)
- Not prioritizing first 3 reels (wild reel more valuable there)

---

## Additional Notes

**Why First 3 Reels Are Better:**
- Reel turns wild when 3 coins collected
- First 3 reels provide more line hit value as wilds

**Wild Duration:**
- Only <strong>1</strong> spin (unlike other coin games with 3 spins)

**Variance Warning:**
- Unlucky picks = Lose money on play
- Lucky picks = Big wins
- Need enough sessions to balance out
