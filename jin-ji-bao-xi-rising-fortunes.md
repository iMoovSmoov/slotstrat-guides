## How The Advantage Works

Jin Ji Bao Xi: Rising Fortunes features a **must-hit-by progressive jackpot**:

**Mechanic:**
- Progressive meter accumulates with each spin
- Guaranteed to trigger before reaching maximum threshold
- Close to must-hit = Increased expected value

**Different from Other Jin Ji Bao Xi Games:**
- Rising Fortunes = Must-hit-by progressive
- Grand Phoenix/Tiger = Persistent bat symbols (counter-based)

---

## PLAY WHEN

<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- Progressive at <strong>85-90%+</strong> of must-hit-by value

**How to Check:**
- View progressive value on game display
- Check help screens/paytable for must-hit-by threshold
- Threshold varies by casino and denomination

| Progressive % of MHB | Action |
|---------------------|--------|
| Below 85% | ❌ Walk away |
| 85-90% | ⚠️ Getting close |
| 90%+ | ✅ **Play** |

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Progressive below <strong>85%</strong> of must-hit-by
- Just triggered and reset
- Unknown must-hit-by threshold

---

## STOP WHEN

- Progressive jackpot triggers and resets
- Advantage is gone until meter rebuilds

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Not checking help screen for must-hit-by threshold
- Playing at max bet (increases variance unnecessarily)
- Not verifying MHB amount (varies by casino)
- Confusing with other Jin Ji Bao Xi games (different mechanics)

---

**Min Bet Strategy:**
- Play at **minimum** bet level that qualifies for progressive
- Minimizes cost per spin
- Reduces variance while maintaining jackpot eligibility

**Base Game:**
- Line hits tend to be relatively weak
- Main value comes from progressive jackpot
