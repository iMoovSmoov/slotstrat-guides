## How The Advantage Works

Reel Climb features **firecrackers that expand reels + activate wild triggers**:

**Game Variants:**
- Celestial Mountain
- Prosperity

**Mechanic:**
- <strong>4</strong> sets of firecrackers above reels 2, 3, and 4
- Arrow symbol lands → One firecracker set explodes, reel expands
- All 4 sets exploded → Reel becomes active for <strong>3</strong> spins
- Dragon on active reel → Entire reel turns wild

**Counting Firecrackers:**
- Arrow on reel = -1 firecracker (explodes next spin)
- Example: 2 firecrackers + arrow = counts as 1

---

## PLAY WHEN (ANY ONE)

**Option A — Low Firecracker Count:**
- Reels 2 + 3 combined have <strong>3</strong> or fewer firecrackers
- Count arrows as -1
- Examples: 1+1=2 ✅, 1+2=3 ✅, 2+2=4 ❌

**Option B — Active Reels:**
- Any reel with glowing outline and number above (<strong>1</strong> or <strong>2</strong>)

**Option C — Imminent Activation:**
- <strong>1</strong> firecracker remaining + arrow symbol on reel
- Reel will become active next spin

**Option D — MAX Arrow:**
- Any arrow symbol that says "MAX"
- Explodes ALL firecrackers above that reel next spin

| Setup | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Reels 2+3 ≤ 3 firecrackers total | ✅ **Play** |
| Glowing reel with 1 or 2 counter | ✅ **Play** |
| 1 firecracker + arrow on reel | ✅ **Play** |
| MAX arrow anywhere | ✅ **Play** |
| Reels 2+3 > 3 firecrackers | ❌ Skip |

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- More than 3 total firecrackers on reels 2+3 combined
- No active reels and no imminent activation
- Only reel 4 progress (less valuable)

---

## STOP WHEN

- All active reel spins complete (counter above reel reaches 0)

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Not counting arrows as -1 firecracker
- Forgetting that active reel ≠ automatic wild (need dragon)
- Playing when reels 2+3 have too many firecrackers
- Missing MAX arrow opportunities

---

## Additional Notes

**High Volatility:**
- Feast-or-famine type game
- Arrow symbols appear frequently
- Plays usually require limited investment

**Active Reel ≠ Wild:**
- After all firecrackers explode, reel is "active"
- Reel only turns wild if dragon symbol lands in it
- Active for 3 spins to try for dragon

**Taller Reels = Better Odds:**
- More symbols = more chances for arrows
- Better chance for 6 crystal ball scatters (bonus trigger)
