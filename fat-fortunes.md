## How The Advantage Works

Fat Fortunes (Fat Cat / Puffy Penguin / Jelly Jams) features **persistent fish with shiny indicator**:

**Mechanic:**
- <strong>6</strong> fish symbols → Triggers bonus
- Fish on reels → Disappear next spin
- Fish above reels → PERSISTENT, move down one position per spin

**The Secret (How to Identify Persistent Fish):**
- Wait a few seconds
- Persistent fish display **shining/gleaming animation**
- Non-shiny fish = NOT persistent (disappear next spin)

---

## PLAY WHEN (EITHER)

**Option A — Fish Above Reels:**
- <strong>2</strong> fish symbols above the reels
- (Always excellent play—fish often come in stacks)

**Option B — Persistent Fish Count:**
- <strong>3+</strong> persistent fish on reels (shiny animation)
- Do NOT count: bottom row fish OR non-shiny fish

| Setup | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 2 fish above reels | ✅ **Play** (excellent) |
| 3+ shiny fish (not bottom row) | ✅ **Play** |
| Only non-shiny fish | ❌ Skip |
| Only bottom row fish | ❌ Skip |

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Fewer than <strong>2</strong> fish above reels
- Fewer than <strong>3</strong> persistent (shiny) fish
- Fish only on bottom row
- Fish without shiny animation

---

## STOP WHEN

- Bonus triggers (6 fish landed)

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Not waiting for shiny animation to identify persistent fish
- Counting non-shiny fish as persistent
- Counting bottom row fish (they disappear)
- Revealing this knowledge to other hustlers

---

## Additional Notes

**Under-the-Radar Game:**
- Most APs don't know about this
- Check only when no other hustlers nearby
- Others who don't know the shiny trick often give up

**Fish Limits:**
- Max <strong>2</strong> fish can appear above reels at once
- Max <strong>4</strong> persistent fish on reels at one time
- Need at least <strong>2</strong> regular fish + persistent fish for bonus

**Different from Kraken Unleashed:**
- All 6 symbols CAN'T come from above
- Must land some regular fish on reels

**Orange Fish (Credit Prizes/Jackpots):**
- Can also be persistent
- Will shine like regular persistent fish

**Wild Symbol:**
- Penguin/Cat face = Wild + <strong>2x</strong> multiplier on all wins

**Jelly Jams Theme:**
- Uses strawberries instead of fish
- Same shiny trick likely applies

**Check All Denominations:**
- Multiple bet levels available
- Check each for plays

**Game Variants:**
- Fat Cat ✅
- Puffy Penguin ✅
- Jelly Jams ✅ (same strategy)
