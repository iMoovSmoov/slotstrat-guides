## How The Advantage Works

Rich Little Piggies features **three progressive pigs** that build up over time:

| Pig | Color | Feature |
|-----|-------|---------|
| **Blue Pig** | 🔵 | Increasing free games (caps at 100) |
| **Yellow Pig** | 🟡 | Jackpot prize chances |
| **Red Pig** | 🔴 | Guaranteed wilds (Hog Wild) OR symbol removal (Meal Ticket) |

**Key Mechanic:**
- Pigs get **fatter** as features build up
- 3 chins = **maximum/fat pig**
- Features trigger **randomly** (NOT must-hit-by)
- Fatter pigs are **NOT more likely to hit**

---

## PLAY WHEN (ANY ONE)

**Option A — Blue Pig Only:**
- Blue pig ≥ <strong>24</strong> free games
- Other pigs: Does not matter

**Option B — Blue + Yellow:**
- Blue pig ≥ <strong>22</strong> free games
- Yellow pig: Fat (3 chins)

**Option C — All Pigs Fat:**
- Blue pig ≥ <strong>20</strong> free games
- Yellow pig: Fat (3 chins)
- Red pig: Fat (3 chins)
- Visual: All 3 pigs squished together

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** These are uncapped progressives. If the setup doesn't clearly match, **do not play**.

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Blue pig below <strong>20</strong> free games
- Only yellow or red pigs are fat (blue must be primary trigger)
- You cannot afford <strong>$1,500+</strong> potential investment
- You are chasing a previous loss on this game
- Feature already partially triggered

---

## STOP WHEN

- Any pig feature triggers
- Bankroll loss exceeds predetermined limit
- Blue pig reaches 50+ without triggering (cut losses)

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Chasing pigs that "look close" (fat pigs are NOT more likely to hit)
- Playing with insufficient bankroll (can easily require $1,500+ investment)
- Expecting blue pig to trigger at 100 (100 is cap, not guaranteed trigger)
- Playing when only yellow/red are fat (blue is the primary value driver)
- Continuing after a single pig triggers without blue

---

## Additional Notes

**Payout Structure:**
- Triggering yellow or red WITHOUT blue = only <strong>7</strong> free games
- Best outcome = triggering <strong>2–3 pigs simultaneously</strong>
- Yellow pig + built-up blue = potentially massive payout

**Cap Information:**
- Blue pig caps at <strong>100</strong> free games
- Reaching 100 does NOT guarantee trigger

**Variants:**
Same strategy applies to: Rich Little Hens, and similar variants

⚠️ **HIGH RISK WARNING:** Most experienced APs avoid this game entirely. Uncapped progressives can create deep losses. One player lost $2,000 chasing a blue pig into the 50s. Only play with substantial bankroll and strict loss limits.
