## How The Advantage Works

Let's Spin / Let's Spin Vegas features **persistent Let's and Spin symbols**:

**Mechanic:**
- Let's (reel 1) + Spin (reel 2) together → Triggers wheel spin
- Symbols persist for <strong>3</strong> spins after landing
- Symbols land in any row → Move to top → Down one row per spin
- Additional Spin symbols in reels 3-4-5 → Add extra multipliers

**Multiplier Rings (Multiply Together):**
| Ring | Reel | Max Multiplier | Jackpot |
|------|------|----------------|---------|
| 1st | 2 | 4x | Mini |
| 2nd | 3 | 5x | Minor |
| 3rd | 4 | 8x | Major |
| 4th | 5 | 10x | Mega |

**Max Combined:** 4x × 5x × 8x × 10x = <strong>1,600x</strong>

## PLAY WHEN (ANY ONE)

**Option A — Let's Symbol:**
- Let's symbol in reel 1
- **NOT on bottom row**

**Option B — Spin Symbol in Reel 2:**
- Spin symbol in reel 2
- **NOT on bottom row**

**Option C — Multiple Spin Symbols:**
- Spin symbols in **both** reels 3 and 4
- **NOT on bottom row**

| Symbol | Reel | Row | Action |
|--------|------|-----|--------|
| Let's | 1 | Top/Middle | ✅ **Play** |
| Let's | 1 | Bottom | ❌ Skip |
| Spin | 2 | Top/Middle | ✅ **Play** |
| Spin | 2 | Bottom | ❌ Skip |
| Spin | 3+4 | Top/Middle | ✅ **Play** |

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Symbols only on bottom row (likely disappear next spin)
- No Let's or Spin symbols visible

---

## STOP WHEN

- Wheel spin bonus completes
- All Let's/Spin symbols move off bottom row

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Playing bottom row symbols (can't tell if first or last appearance)
- Not recognizing multipliers MULTIPLY (not add)
- Missing massive combined multiplier opportunities

---

## Additional Notes

**Bottom Row Uncertainty:**
- Can't tell if bottom row symbol is new or expiring
- Safest: Assume bottom row symbols disappear next spin
- Players who understand often cash out after 3 spins

**Multiplier Math:**
- Multipliers MULTIPLY together
- 3x + 5x + 7x = <strong>105x</strong> (not 15x)
- 3-4 multipliers at once = Massive wins

**Let's Symbol Value:**
- Contains credit prize (1x-5x bet)
- This is the base amount multipliers apply to

**Free Check Method:**
1. Tap menu icon (lower left corner)
2. Use up/down arrows to cycle bet levels
3. No ticket required

**Game Variants:**
- Let's Spin ✅
- Let's Spin Vegas ✅ (same strategy)
