## How The Advantage Works

Dawn of Ra / Sun of Ra features **persistent pyramid stacks**:

**Mechanic:**
- Sun OR pyramid symbol in ALL 5 reels → Awards credit prizes
- Full stack of pyramids lands in reel 3, 4, or 5 → Persists for <strong>3</strong> spins
- Pyramids also function as wilds

**Pyramid Value by Reel:**
| Reel | Jackpot Potential | Credit Prize Range |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Reel 3 | Mini, Minor | Smaller |
| Reel 4 | Major | Larger |
| Reel 5 | Grand | Largest |

---

## PLAY WHEN

<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- Yellow pyramid indicators lit below reel 3, 4, or 5

**How to Check:**
- Look at indicator lights BELOW reels 3, 4, and 5
- Filled yellow pyramids = Active persistent stack
- More filled = More spins remaining

| Indicator State | Action |
|-----------------|--------|
| 1+ pyramids filled (reel 3, 4, or 5) | ✅ **Play** |
| All indicators empty | ❌ Walk away |

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- No yellow pyramid indicators lit
- All pyramid indicator spins depleted

---

## STOP WHEN

- All pyramid indicator spins deplete
- All indicators become empty

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Not checking indicators below reels 3, 4, 5
- Missing the yellow pyramid fill state
- Not understanding higher reels = bigger prizes

---
