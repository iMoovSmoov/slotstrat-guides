## How The Advantage Works

Wish Mistress features **gem collection** that triggers wild features:

**Mechanic:**
- Collect blue, red, and yellow gems
- <strong>4</strong> gems of single color → Activates wilds feature
- Goal: Trigger 2 colors simultaneously for good payout

**Gem Value Hierarchy:**
| Color | Wild Type | Value |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Blue | Full reel wilds | Best |
| Yellow | Surrounding wilds | Medium |
| Red | Random position wilds | Worst |

---

## PLAY WHEN (ANY ONE)

**Option A — Double Trigger Setup:**
- <strong>2</strong> meters at <strong>3</strong> gems each
- (One gem away from double trigger)

**Option B — Blue + Yellow Focus:**
- <strong>5+</strong> combined blue and yellow gems
- (Prioritize blue over yellow, avoid red-heavy)

| Gems | Blue+Yellow | Action |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 3+3 (two meters) | Any | ✅ **Play** |
| Any | 5+ | ✅ **Play** |
| Single meter at 3 | Below 5 | ❌ Skip |

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Only one meter at 3 gems
- Red-heavy gem distribution
- Combined blue + yellow below <strong>5</strong>

---

## STOP WHEN

- Wild feature triggers
- Gem meter(s) reset to zero

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Playing single color at 3 gems (usually doesn't pay well)
- Prioritizing red gems (least lucrative)
- Not recognizing double trigger potential

---

## Additional Notes

**Double Trigger Strategy:**
- Single wild feature = Usually poor payout
- Two features at once = Good payout
- Aim for 3-3 setup or 5+ blue/yellow combined

**Gem Priority:**
1. Blue (full reel wilds) — Best
2. Yellow (surrounding wilds) — Medium
3. Red (random wilds) — Avoid prioritizing

**Game Pace:**
- Gems accumulate quickly
- Very fast-paced game

**Free Games Bonus:**
- 3 options available
- All pay same on average
- 2-spin option = Most volatile
