## How The Advantage Works

Sphinx 4D features **wild spheres** that move down (unlike Ocean Magic which moves up):

**Mechanic:**
- Wild spheres move **down one row** every spin
- Sphere lands on lion/lioness symbol → All surrounding symbols turn wild
- Expansion: 3 spaces above, 3 below, 1 each side (if room)

**Modes:**
| Mode | Trigger Symbol | Visual |
|------|----------------|--------|
| Day | Yellow lion | Day background |
| Night | Blue lioness | Night background |

---

## PLAY WHEN

**Reels 2-3 (Most Valuable):**
- Wild sphere NOT on bottom row

**Reels 1 and 4:**
- Wild sphere in **top two rows only**

| Reel | Position | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| 2-3 | Top row | ✅ **Play** |
| 2-3 | Middle row | ✅ **Play** |
| 2-3 | Bottom row | ❌ Skip |
| 1 or 4 | Top row | ✅ **Play** |
| 1 or 4 | 2nd from top | ✅ **Play** |
| 1 or 4 | Lower rows | ❌ Skip |

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Wild spheres on bottom row (exit next spin)
- Wild spheres in reels 1/4 below top two rows
- Spheres only in positions without room to expand

---

## STOP WHEN

- Wild sphere moves off bottom row
- Sphere triggers expansion on lion/lioness
- No spheres remain in playable positions

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Thinking spheres move UP (they move DOWN—opposite of Ocean Magic)
- Playing bottom row spheres (exit next spin)
- Playing reels 1/4 below top two rows (not enough expansion room)
- Thinking 4D gimmicks offer advantage (they don't)

---

## Additional Notes

**Why Reels 2-3 Most Valuable:**
- More room to expand when landing on lion symbol
- Full expansion possible: 3 up, 3 down, 1 each side

**4D Gimmicks (No Advantage):**
- Draw circle → Switch day/night mode
- Draw butterflies → Secret butterfly bonus
- All just novelties—no AP value

**Movement Direction:**
- Sphinx 4D: Spheres move **DOWN**
- Ocean Magic: Bubbles move **UP**
- Don't confuse them

**RTP:** 86% to 96%
