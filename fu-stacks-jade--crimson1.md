## How The Advantage Works

Fu Stacks (Jade / Crimson) features **coin collection for matching symbol stacks**:

**Mechanic:**
- Coins land → Slide open to reveal matching symbols
- Stack of <strong>3</strong> coins lands → Adds 1 coin to holder above
- Coin holder reaches <strong>3</strong> coins → Reel features coin stacks for <strong>3</strong> spins

**Key Difference from Similar Games:**
- Reels DON'T turn wild
- Stacks reveal matching symbols (all coins match each other)

---

## PLAY WHEN (EITHER)

**Option A — Coin Setup:**
- <strong>2</strong> coins in EACH of the first 3 reels (coin holders above)

**Option B — Active Stacks:**
- Active stack in any of first 3 reels
- Active = Glowing border around reel

| Setup | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 2 coins in reels 1, 2, AND 3 | ✅ **Play** |
| Active stack in reels 1-3 | ✅ **Play** |
| Active stack only in reel 4 | ❌ Skip (little value) |
| Coins not in all first 3 reels | ❌ Skip |

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- First 3 reels don't all have 2 coins
- Active stacks only in reels 4-5
- No glowing borders on first 3 reels

---

## STOP WHEN

- Active stack spins deplete
- First 3 reels no longer have adequate coins

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Playing active stacks in reel 4 alone (not enough value)
- Not understanding goal is reels 1-3 active together
- Thinking reels turn wild (they don't—just matching symbols)

---

## Additional Notes

**Why First 3 Reels Matter:**
- Reels 1-3 active together = GUARANTEED line hit
- Reels 2-3-4 active = Still need luck to match reel 1
- Always prioritize first 3 reels

**Four Chances to Match:**
- Stacks reveal matching symbols ON the spin they land
- So you get 4 chances, not just 3

**Single Active Stack Value:**
- Still has value in first 3 reels
- Will match all other coin-revealed symbols
- Single coins land frequently (not always stacks)

**Win Potential:**
- 100x+ line hits possible with 5 premium symbols

**Game Variants:**
- Fu Stacks: Jade ✅
- Fu Stacks: Crimson ✅ (same strategy, different free games)
