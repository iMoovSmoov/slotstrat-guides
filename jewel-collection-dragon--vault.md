## How The Advantage Works

Jewel Collection features **four jewel meters + scatter meter**:

**Jewel Meters (Extra Wilds):**
| Meter | Color | Reset Range | Cap |
|-------|-------|-------------|-----|
| Amethyst | Purple | 50-70 | 100 |
| Sapphire | Blue | 70-100 | 150 |
| Emerald | Green | 100-150 | 200 |
| Ruby | Red | 150-200 | 300 |

**Mechanic:**
- Jewel lands → +<strong>5</strong> wilds to corresponding meter
- Wilds added to reel strip (NOT guaranteed to land)
- Amethyst triggers randomly; others trigger with free games

**Scatter Meter (Must-Hit-By 777):**
- Located above reel 2
- Scatter symbol lands → Meter +1
- Guaranteed to trigger by <strong>777</strong>
- Awards mystery free games (sapphire, emerald, or ruby)
- Resets to 10, 30, 50, or 100

---

## ⚠️ HIGH VARIANCE WARNING

**This is NOT like Regal Riches:**
- Wilds are NOT guaranteed to land
- Meters are capped at low values
- Individual meters are NOT +EV alone
- Combined equity creates advantage

---

## PLAY WHEN (EITHER)

**Option A — Scatter Meter:**
- Scatter meter at <strong>480+</strong> of 777

**Option B — Combined Jewel Wilds:**
- Total extra wilds across ALL 4 meters ≥ <strong>610</strong>

| Meter | Threshold | Where to Check |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Scatter | <strong>480+</strong> | Above reel 2 |
| Jewels combined | <strong>610+</strong> | Bet pad (3 meters) + screen (amethyst) |

**How to Check:**
- Bet pad shows: Sapphire, Emerald, Ruby
- Screen shows: Amethyst (check separately!)

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Scatter meter below <strong>480</strong>
- Combined jewel wilds below <strong>610</strong>
- Chasing individual jewel meters (not +EV alone)

---

## STOP WHEN

- Mystery free games triggers (scatter hits 777)
- Any jewel bonus triggers (amethyst, sapphire, emerald, or ruby)

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Thinking this plays like Regal Riches (very different)
- Chasing individual jewel meters (need combined total)
- Forgetting to check amethyst meter on screen (not on bet pad)
- Expecting consistent wins (very volatile)

---

## Additional Notes

**Scatter Meter Weighting:**
- Weighted to trigger at lower numbers
- Rare to reach 600s
- Very rare to reach 700s
- Higher meter = higher trigger probability

**Bonus Variance:**
- Can get massive wins when wilds align
- Can get nothing when wilds don't land
- +EV long-term, but need many sessions

**Jewel Features:**
- Sapphire/Emerald/Ruby: 2 bonus + jewel symbol = <strong>7</strong> free games
- Amethyst: Triggers randomly
- Excess wilds saved if meter capped

**Comparison to Similar Games:**
| Feature | Jewel Collection | Regal Riches |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| Wilds guaranteed | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Must-hit-by | Scatter only | All meters |
| Caps | Low | Higher |
| Advantage quality | Moderate | Excellent |
