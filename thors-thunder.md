## How The Advantage Works

Thor's Thunder features **Storm Mode with enhanced Thor symbol odds**:

**Normal Mechanic:**
- Thor symbol in center → Awards all prizes on other reel positions
- Hyper Spin feature triggers randomly (many credit prizes land)
- Storm symbol + Thor in center → Triggers Storm Mode

**Storm Mode (The +EV State):**
- Hyper Spin triggers more frequently
- Thor symbol is <strong>70%</strong> more likely to land
- Lasts up to <strong>10</strong> spins (ends randomly)

---

## PLAY WHEN

**Simple Check:**
- Storm Mode active
- Look for: "Storm Mode" displayed above reels
- Look for: Red highlighted text on bet pad for that bet level

| Indicator | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Red text on bet pad + "Storm Mode" above reels | ✅ **Play** |
| Normal text on bet pad | ❌ Skip |
