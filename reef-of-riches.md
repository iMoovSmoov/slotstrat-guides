## How The Advantage Works

Reef of Riches features **tile shattering for bonus trigger**:

**Game Variants:**
- Reef of Riches
- Wild Mermaid

**Mechanic:**
- 5x4 reelset with <strong>20</strong> tiles behind symbols
- Tiles shattered by: line hits, scatter symbols, or pirate character
- All <strong>20</strong> tiles shattered → Bonus triggers

**Tile Difficulty by Position:**
| Reel Position | Difficulty | Reason |
|---------------|------------|--------|
| Reels 1-3 | Easier | Line hits cover first 3 reels frequently |
| Reel 4 | Medium | Less frequent line coverage |
| Reel 5 | Hardest | Rarely hit by line wins |

---

## PLAY WHEN (ANY ONE)

**Option A — Low Tile Count:**
- <strong>2</strong> or fewer tiles remaining anywhere
- Check bet pad directly for count

**Option B — Fifth Reel Clear:**
- <strong>0</strong> tiles remaining in fifth reel
- Rare but best opportunity (hardest tiles already gone)

| Tiles Remaining | Action |
|-----------------|--------|
| 0-2 anywhere | ✅ **Play** |
| 0 in reel 5 | ✅ **Play** (best case) |
| 3+ tiles | ❌ Skip |

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- More than 2 tiles remaining
- Tiles concentrated in reel 5 (frustrating grind)

---

## STOP WHEN

- All 20 tiles shattered and bonus triggers

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Playing with too many tiles remaining (3+)
- Not checking bet pad for exact count
- Underestimating frustration of final reel 5 tiles
- Expecting consistent bonus payouts

---

## Additional Notes

**Final Tile Frustration:**
- Last tiles tend to be in reel 5
- Can take many spins to shatter
- Be prepared for extended play

**Bonus Variance:**
- Bonus can often disappoint
- Occasional big wins with retriggers
- Don't expect consistent payouts

**Post-Bonus Reset:**
- Never resets to exactly 20 tiles
- Random tiles shattered after bonus
- Sometimes entire 5th column clears (best case)

**Free Check Method:**
- Look directly on bet pad for tile count
- Shows remaining tiles for each bet level
