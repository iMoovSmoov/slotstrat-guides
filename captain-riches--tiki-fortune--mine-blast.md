## How The Advantage Works

Captain Riches / Tiki Fortune / Mine Blast features **coin holders** above reels 2, 3, and 4:

**Mechanic:**
- Collect 3 coins in holder → Reel turns wild for <strong>3</strong> spins
- Active wild = Glowing gold border + coins showing spins remaining
- Coins deplete each spin until wild expires

⚠️ **AP TRAP WARNING:** This game is designed to trick players. Understand the mechanics before playing.

---

## ⚠️ THE TRAP EXPLAINED

**Why 2 coins above reels is NOT a play:**
- Game rules: "Chances of collecting coins may differ based on coins already collected"
- Translation: First 2 coins land quickly, 3rd coin is **much harder**
- 2/3 coins is extremely common—this should be your clue it's not +EV
- APs regularly get destroyed playing 2-coin states

---

## PLAY WHEN

**Active Wild in Reel 2 or 3:**
- Glowing gold border around reel ✓
- Coins visible above showing spins remaining ✓
- ❌ If gold border but NO coins above → Do NOT play

**Active Wild in Reel 4:**
- Only if multiplier coins (2x or 3x) visible above that reel
- Regular coins in reel 4 = Not worth it

| Reel | Active Wild | Multiplier Coins | Action |
|------|-------------|------------------|--------|
| 2 | ✅ Yes | Any | ✅ **Play** |
| 3 | ✅ Yes | Any | ✅ **Play** |
| 4 | ✅ Yes | 2x or 3x | ✅ **Play** |
| 4 | ✅ Yes | None | ❌ Skip |
| Any | Gold border only | — | ❌ Skip |

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Only 2 coins above any reel (NOT active wild)
- Gold border but no coins above
- Reel 4 active but no multiplier coins
- Chasing treasure chests/tiki heads (cosmetic only)

---

## STOP WHEN

- Wild spins complete (coins above deplete to 0)
- No active wilds remaining

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Playing 2/3 coins thinking it's close (3rd coin is rigged to be rare)
- Thinking treasure chests = closer to jackpot (purely cosmetic)
- Playing reel 4 wilds without multipliers
- Playing gold border with no coins above
- Chasing jackpots (not must-hit-by)

---

## Additional Notes

**The Deception:**
- First 2 coins land very quickly
- 3rd coin is programmed to be much harder
- Game tricks you into thinking 2/3 is good—it's not

**Multiplier Coins:**
- Reels 2 and 3 each have two 3x multiplier coins
- Reel 4: 2x or 3x multipliers are valuable

**Treasure Chests / Tiki Heads:**
- Purely cosmetic display
- More revealed ≠ closer to bonus
- Do NOT chase these

**Free Check Method:**
- Tap bet level on touchscreen
- No money or bet required

**Game Variants:**
- Captain Riches ✅
- Tiki Fortune ✅
- Mine Blast ✅ (newer clone, plays same)

**RTP:** 85% – 96.07%
