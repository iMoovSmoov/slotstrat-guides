## How The Advantage Works

Fortune Owl features **three progressive free games meters** (NOT must-hit-by):

**Mechanic:**
- Free games symbol lands in reel 4 → Corresponding meter increases
- Bonus triggered → Win accumulated free games
- Reset value: <strong>5</strong> free games (all meters)

**Free Games Wild Reels:**
| Meter | Color | Wild Reels Per Spin |
|-------|-------|---------------------|
| Mini | Purple | 1 full reel |
| Minor | Green | 2 full reels |
| Major | Red | 3 full reels |

---

## ⚠️ BANKROLL WARNING

**This is NOT a must-hit-by game.**
- Completely random when bonus triggers
- Requires <strong>1000+</strong> unit bankroll
- Only for experienced APs
- Most common way APs get destroyed

---

## PLAY WHEN

| Meter | Color | Free Games Threshold |
|-------|-------|---------------------|
| Mini | Purple | ≥ <strong>24</strong> |
| Minor | Green | ≥ <strong>32</strong> |
| Major | Red | ≥ <strong>52</strong> |

**How to Check:**
- Look directly on bet pad
- Shows free games count for all bet levels

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Mini below <strong>24</strong> free games
- Minor below <strong>32</strong> free games
- Major below <strong>52</strong> free games
- Bankroll below <strong>1000</strong> units
- You are a newer AP with limited bankroll

---

## STOP WHEN

- Free games bonus triggers
- Meter resets to <strong>5</strong>
- You hit your loss limit (set one before playing)

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Thinking more spins = closer to hitting (NOT TRUE)
- Chasing without adequate bankroll
- Not setting a loss limit before playing
- Abandoning play seems wrong but is often correct for bankroll management

---

## Additional Notes

**Critical Bankroll Warning:**
- "On average" is key—you may not hit in average spins
- Digging deeper hole doesn't mean closer to hitting
- Set a budget you're comfortable losing
- If you don't hit, call it a loss and move on
- Bankroll management is crucially important

**Game Similarity:**
- Similar to Wolf Run Eclipse
- No mega free games → Less volatile
- EV more realizable than Wolf Run Eclipse

**Recommended Bankroll:**
- <strong>1000</strong> units minimum for uncapped progressives
- This is a general rule of thumb
