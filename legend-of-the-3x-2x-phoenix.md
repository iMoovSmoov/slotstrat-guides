## How The Advantage Works

Legend of the 3X 2X Phoenix / Triple Double Diamond features **three must-hit-by meters** at 15:

**Meter Types:**
| Meter | Reset Value | Multiplier | Behavior |
|-------|-------------|------------|----------|
| Red | 5 | 2x | Rarely reaches 14 (hits early) |
| Green | 7 | 5x | Often hits early |
| Blue | 10 | 10x | Usually goes to 15 |

**Unique Mechanic:**
- Meters increment at fixed rate based on spins
- RTP setting determines spins needed per increment
- Flames appear when past average hit point

---

## PLAY WHEN

<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- Any meter at <strong>14</strong>

**91%+ RTP Machines:**
- Green (5x) at <strong>13</strong> is also playable

| Meter | Count | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Any | 14 | ✅ **Play** |
| Green | 13 | ✅ **Play** (91%+ RTP only) |
| Any | Below 13 | ❌ Walk away |

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- All meters below <strong>14</strong>
- 85-87% RTP machine with fresh 14 (wait for buildup)
- Taking game at 13 (rarely profitable)

---

## STOP WHEN

- Free games meter triggers at <strong>15</strong>
- Meter resets to starting value

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Playing at 13 (rarely profitable)
- Playing fresh 14s on low RTP (85-87%) machines
- Not knowing RTP affects profitability significantly
- Expecting blue (10x) to always work out (can still lose)

---

## RTP DETERMINATION

Count spins to increment meters to determine RTP:

| RTP | Red Spins | Green Spins | Blue Spins |
|-----|-----------|-------------|------------|
| 85% | 110 | 330 | 850 |
| 87% | 75 | 250 | 600 |
| 89% | 48 | 175 | 600 |
| 91% | 45 | 120 | 550 |
| 93% | 40 | 100 | 480 |
| 95% | 38 | 80 | 450 |
| 96% | 35 | 75 | 450 |
