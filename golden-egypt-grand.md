## How The Advantage Works

Golden Egypt Grand features **coin holders** above each reel:

**Mechanic:**
- Coins land above reels
- Coin holder fills → Reel turns WILD
- Wild lasts 2-4 spins (based on coins in holder)
- Active wild = Glowing gold border + coins above

**Notation:** 1-2-0-0-0 = Reel 1 has 1 coin, Reel 2 has 2 coins, Reels 3-5 have 0

---

## PLAY WHEN (ANY ONE)

**Option A — Two Reels Ready (First Three):**
- <strong>2</strong> of first 3 reels are 1 coin away from wild
- Examples: 1-2-0-0-0 | 0-2-3-0-0 | 1-0-3-0-0

**Option B — Six Coins Total:**
- <strong>6+</strong> coins in first 4 reels
- Examples: 1-1-2-2-0 | 0-2-2-2-0 | 0-1-3-2-0

**Option C — Active Wilds in First Three:**
- Any active wild in reels 1-3
- (Glowing gold border + coins above)

**Option D — Reel 4 Active + Setup:**
- Reel 4 has active wild
- AND any of first 3 reels is 1 coin away
- Play 1-2 spins to try landing coin for double wild

**Option E — Reels 4 AND 5 Active:**
- Active wilds in **both** reels 4 and 5

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Only reel 4 or 5 active alone
- Fewer than 6 coins with no reels near trigger
- No active wilds and not enough coin setup

---

## STOP WHEN

- All wild spins deplete
- Coins above reels empty

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Playing single active wild in reel 4 or 5
- Not counting total coins in first 4 reels
- Not recognizing active wild indicator (gold border)

---
