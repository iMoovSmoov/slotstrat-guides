## How The Advantage Works

Ocean Magic Grand features **wild bubbles that move UP**:

**Mechanic:**
- Wild bubbles move UP one row every spin
- Bubble lands on Ocean Magic symbol → ALL surrounding symbols turn wild
- Expansion: symbols above, below, left, right (if room)

**Key Differences from Regular Ocean Magic:**
- 50% taller reels
- Play tighter (single bubbles worth less)
- Multiple bubbles = Even bigger win potential

**Strategy is SAME for Regular and Bubble Boost modes.**

## PLAY WHEN (ANY ONE)

**Option A — Reels 2-3 (Most Valuable):**
- Wild bubbles in reels 2 or 3
- Include "sunrise" bubbles below bottom row
- Stop when bubble reaches 2nd row from top

**Option B — Reels 1 + 4 Combo:**
- Bubble in reel 1 AND bubble in reel 4
- Bubbles within 1-2 rows of each other
- Stop when either reaches 2nd row from top

**Option C — Sunrise Bubbles (Test Spin):**
- Sunrise bubble in reel 1 or 4
- Play 1 spin to check for foghorn or additional bubbles

| Bubble Location | Action |
|-----------------|--------|
| Reels 2-3 (any row including sunrise) | ✅ **Play** |
| Reel 1 + Reel 4 (aligned) | ✅ **Play** |
| Sunrise in reel 1 or 4 | ✅ **1 spin test** |
| Reel 5 only | ❌ Skip (mostly worthless) |

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Bubble reaches 2nd row from top (only 1 spin remaining)
- Only reel 5 bubbles
- Single bubble in reel 1 without reel 4 partner

---

## STOP WHEN

- Bubble reaches 2nd row from top (1 spin remaining)

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Not checking sunrise bubbles (often overlooked)
- Playing single reel 1 bubbles without reel 4 partner
- Not stopping when bubble reaches 2nd-from-top row
- Confusing expanded wilds with real bubbles

---

## Additional Notes

**Sunrise Bubbles (Below Bottom Row):**
- Most valuable because often overlooked
- Come up in spurts
- Always check these!

**Distinguishing Real Bubbles from Expanded Wilds:**
- After expansion, screen shows wilds everywhere
- Hard to tell which are real bubbles
- **Trick:** Switch bet level and back → Expanded wilds disappear

**Why Reels 2-3 Are Best:**
- More room to expand on both sides
- Top row bubbles less valuable (less expansion room)

**Multiple Bubbles = Big Wins:**
- Single bubble without expansion = Likely loss
- Multiple bubble expansions = Gigantic wins

**Bubble Boost Mode:**
- Same strategy as regular mode
- Bubbles come in streaks
- Foghorn more likely when bubbles already present
- Extra cost evens out with foghorn wins

**Free Games Bonus:**
- Bubble pick is just entertainment
- No effect on outcome
