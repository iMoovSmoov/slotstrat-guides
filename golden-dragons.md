## How The Advantage Works

Golden Dragon / Golden Guardian features **5 pots** at the bottom of each reel:

**Trigger Mechanic:**
- Tall dragon symbol lands fully within a reel
- Player wins the prize in that reel's pot
- After ANY pot triggers → **All pots reset randomly**

**Possible Pot Prizes:**

| Prize | Color | Value |
|-------|-------|-------|
| 8 Free Games | ❌ Low | Avoid |
| 12 Free Games | 🟡 Medium | Marginal |
| 16 Free Games | 🟢 Green | Good |
| 20 Free Games | 🟢 Green | Good |
| 24 Free Games | 🔴 Red | Excellent |
| Jackpot Wheel | 🎡 Wheel | Excellent |

## PLAY WHEN

<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- <strong>4 of 5</strong> pots contain high-value prizes

<strong>High-Value Prizes:</strong>
- Jackpot Wheel spin
- 24 free games (red)
- 20 free games (green)
- 16 free games (green)

<strong>Pot Configuration Check:</strong>
- Pot 1 (Reel 1): High value? ✅/❌
- Pot 2 (Reel 2): High value? ✅/❌
- Pot 3 (Reel 3): High value? ✅/❌
- Pot 4 (Reel 4): High value? ✅/❌
- Pot 5 (Reel 5): High value? ✅/❌

**Need ≥4 checkmarks to play.**

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Each pot has only 20% chance of being triggered. Don't play for a single good pot.

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Any pot shows <strong>8 free games</strong> (too high risk of hitting it)
- Fewer than <strong>4</strong> high-value pots
- Only 1 excellent pot (24 free games or wheel) with poor others
- You cannot handle high variance

---

## STOP WHEN

- Any pot triggers (all pots reset afterward)
- Bankroll loss exceeds predetermined limit

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Playing for a single 24 free games pot (only 20% chance to hit it)
- Not checking ALL 5 pots before playing
- Playing with ANY 8 free games pot visible
- Underestimating the variance (can take many spins to trigger)
- Continuing after a pot triggers (all pots reset)
