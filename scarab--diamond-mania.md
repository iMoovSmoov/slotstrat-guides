## How The Advantage Works

Scarab / Diamond Mania operates on a **10-game cycle with locking frames**:

**Game Variants:**
- Legend of the 3X 2X Phoenix / Triple Double Diamond Scarab
- Diamond Mania (clone)

**Mechanic:**
- Frames lock during <strong>10</strong> game cycle
- Spin 10: ALL locked frames turn wild
- Board resets after spin 10

**Why Mid-Cycle is Valuable:**
- Payout based on full 10-game cycle average
- Starting mid-cycle = Same return potential, half the cost
- Fewer frames needed later in cycle

---

## PLAY WHEN

**Simplified Rule:**
- Lots of frames on the LEFT (reels 1-3)
- Preferably connected HORIZONTALLY (for 4-of-a-kind or 5-of-a-kind)
- Further in cycle = Better

**Detailed Thresholds:**

| Spin | Frames Needed | Location |
|------|---------------|----------|
| 10 of 10 | ❌ **NEVER** | N/A |
| 9 of 10 | <strong>1+</strong> | First 3 reels |
| 8-7 of 10 | <strong>2+</strong> same row | First 3 reels |
| 6-5 of 10 | <strong>3+</strong> same row | First 4 reels |
| 4-3 of 10 | <strong>4+</strong> OR <strong>3+</strong> same row | First 3 reels OR first 4 (same row) |
| 2-1 of 10 | <strong>5+</strong> OR <strong>3+</strong> same row | First 3 reels OR first 4 (same row) |

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Spin 10 of 10 (wilds activate THIS spin, too late)
- Frames not connected horizontally (early in cycle)
- Fewer frames than threshold for spin position

---

## STOP WHEN

- Spin 10 completes (frames turn wild, board resets)

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Playing spin 10 of 10 (no value left)
- Focusing on 3-of-a-kind setups (pays poorly)
- Not prioritizing horizontal connections
- Playing early cycle with scattered frames

---

## Additional Notes

**Spin 9 Opportunity:**
- Almost always worth playing
- Additional frames can land on spin 10 (instantly wild)
- Low-cost +EV play

**Horizontal Priority:**
- 3-of-a-kind pays poorly
- Aim for 4-of-a-kind or 5-of-a-kind
- Later in cycle: Focus on horizontal alignment
- Earlier in cycle: Total frame count matters more

**Free Games Bonus:**
| Choice | Free Games | Random Wilds | Volatility |
|--------|------------|--------------|------------|
| Option 1 | 15 | 5 | Lowest |
| Option 2 | 10 | 7 | Medium |
| Option 3 | 5 | 10 | Highest |

All options pay the same average. Choose 15 games for lowest variance.
