## How The Advantage Works

Kraken Unleashed (Lobster Bay / Wild Vikings / Dive for Five) features **wood panels** that shift down:

**Mechanic:**
- Wood panels with credit prizes land on reels 1-4 only
- Each spin → Panels shift **down one row**
- <strong>6</strong> panels visible → Triggers Hold & Spin bonus
- Panels often land in stacks up to 4 tall

**Panel Behavior:**
- Start in top row → Shift down each spin
- Exit screen from bottom row
- Smaller credit values = Taller stacks (more lucrative for bonus)

---

## PLAY WHEN (ANY ONE)

**Option A — Top Row Panels:**
- <strong>2+</strong> wood panels in top row (reels 1-4)

**Option B — Split Position:**
- <strong>1</strong> panel in top row
- <strong>2+</strong> panels in middle row

**Option C — Aggressive (High RTP):**
- Any panel in top row
- ❌ **EXCEPT:** Stack of 4 just shifted, bottom panel exited (nothing above)

| Top Row Panels | Middle Row | Action |
|----------------|------------|--------|
| 2+ | Any | ✅ **Play** |
| 1 | 2+ | ✅ **Play** |
| 1 | 0-1 | ⚠️ Aggressive only |
| 0 | Any | ❌ Walk away |

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- No panels in top row
- Stack of 4 just shifted off bottom (no more coming)
- Panels only in reels 5 (panels only appear reels 1-4)

---

## STOP WHEN

- Hold & Spin bonus triggers (<strong>6</strong> panels)
- All panels shift off bottom of reels
- No panels remaining in top/middle rows

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Playing panels in reel 5 (panels only appear reels 1-4)
