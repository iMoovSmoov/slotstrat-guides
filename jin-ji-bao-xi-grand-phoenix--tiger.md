## How The Advantage Works

Jin Ji Bao Xi Grand (Phoenix/Tiger) features **wild bat symbols that lock on reels**:

**Mechanic:**
- Bat symbol lands → Locks for <strong>2</strong> spins
- Additional bat lands → Resets counter to <strong>2</strong>
- <strong>6</strong> bats/coins total → Triggers bonus feature

**Key Detail:**
- Bat coins show 3 → 2 → 1 (misleading visual)
- Actual persistence: <strong>2 spins only</strong>
- Check "locked for X spins" text (upper left above reels)

**Bat Locations:**
- Only appear on reels 2, 3, and 4

---

## PLAY WHEN (ANY ONE)

<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- Text shows "locked for 2 spins" OR "locked for 1 spin"

**Option A — Single Bat:**
- <strong>1</strong> locked bat on reels 2, 3, or 4
- With <strong>2+</strong> spins remaining

**Option B — Multiple Bats:**
- <strong>2</strong> locked bats anywhere
- With <strong>2+</strong> spins remaining

| Bats | Spins Remaining | Action |
|------|-----------------|--------|
| 1 bat (reels 2-4) | 2+ | ✅ **Play** |
| 2 bats anywhere | 2+ | ✅ **Play** |
| Any bats | 1 coin showing (last spin) | ❌ Skip |
| 0 bats | - | ❌ Skip |

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Bats showing only <strong>1</strong> coin (disappear next spin)
- No "locked for X spins" text visible
- No locked bats present

---

## STOP WHEN

- All locked bats disappear
- Bonus feature triggers

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Playing bats with 1 coin (they disappear immediately)
- Thinking coin bowl matters (it doesn't indicate bonus proximity)
- Confusing with other Jin Ji Bao Xi games (different mechanics)
- Not checking "locked for X spins" text

---

## Additional Notes

**Coin Visual vs Reality:**
- Bats display 3 coins → 2 → 1
- But they only persist for <strong>2 spins</strong>
- 1 coin = LAST SPIN (don't play)
- Always verify with "locked for X spins" text

**Bonus Choice:**
- Free games OR top-up feature
- Both pay same on average (same RTP)

**Base Game:**
- Line hits are weak
- Need 5-of-a-kind premium symbols for good payouts

**Ignore the Gold Bowl:**
- More coins does NOT mean closer to bonus
- Purely visual, not mechanical

**Jin Ji Bao Xi Series:**
