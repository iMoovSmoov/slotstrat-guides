**Description:** Dragon Unleashed comes in a variety of themes, but they all play the same for advantage purposes.

## How The Advantage Works

Dragon Unleashed features **persistent orbs** that shift down each spin:

**Mechanic:**
- Orbs with credit prizes land on reels 1–4
- Each spin → Orbs shift **down one row**
- Land <strong>6</strong> orbs → Triggers hold & spin feature
- Orbs often land as connected stacks (up to 4 tall)

**Orb Values:**
- Credit prizes: 1x to 100x bet
- Mini, Minor, Major jackpots

---

## PLAY WHEN (ANY ONE)

**Option A — Basic (Recommended):**
- <strong>2+</strong> orbs in top row (reels 1–4)

**Option B — Mixed Position:**
- <strong>1</strong> orb in top row **AND**
- <strong>2+</strong> orbs in middle row

**Option C — Aggressive (Higher RTP):**
- Any orb in top row
- ❌ **EXCEPT:** 4-stack where bottom orb just exited (no more orbs coming from above)

**Orb Position Check:**
| Row | Orb Count | Action |
|-----|-----------|--------|
| Top | 2+ | ✅ **Play** |
| Top + Middle | 1 + 2+ | ✅ **Play** |
| Middle only | Any | ❌ Walk away |
| Bottom only | Any | ❌ Walk away |

⚠️ **NOTE:** Orbs only appear on reels <strong>1–4</strong> (not reel 5).

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- No orbs in top row
- Only orbs in middle/bottom rows
- 4-stack with bottom orb just shifted off screen
- Just triggered feature (orbs reset)

---

## STOP WHEN

- Hold & spin triggers (<strong>6</strong> orbs landed)
- All orbs shift off bottom of reels

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Counting orbs in reel 5 (orbs only appear reels 1–4)
- Playing when orbs only in middle/bottom rows
- Not recognizing 4-stack exhaustion pattern
- Not checking all denominations

---

## Additional Notes

**Volatility:**
- Low volatility game with big upside
- Small investment (few spins to see if feature triggers)
- Minimal losses per play

**Respin Mechanic:**
- Respin symbol lands in reel 5 → Reels with orbs lock
- Other reels spin again (free spin)
- Can't cash out during respin
- Can't find respins left behind

**Orb Stack Behavior:**
- Smaller credit prize orbs → Taller stacks (more lucrative for triggering)
- Large credit prize orbs → Usually single or short stacks

**Hold & Spin Feature:**
- Fill all <strong>12</strong> positions → Dragon Unleashed reel spin
- Dragon reel contains: Mini/Minor/Major/Grand jackpots, 20x–500x credits, or 2x–5x multiplier

**Denominations:**
- Multiple denominations available
- Check all bet levels for plays
