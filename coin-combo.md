## How The Advantage Works

Coin Combo: Hurricane Horse / Perfect Peacock features **persistent wilds** on reels 3, 4, and 5:

**Mechanic:**
- Wilds randomly appear on reels 3, 4, and 5
- Each spin → Wilds move **up one row**
- Wilds exit screen from top row
- Hurricane Horse: Purple Chinese character wilds
- Perfect Peacock: Blue peacock wilds (says "WILD")

---

## PLAY WHEN (ANY ONE)

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Do NOT count wilds on the top row—they leave next spin.

**Option A — Reel 3 (Middle):**
- <strong>2</strong> wilds in reel 3 (middle reel)

**Option B — Reels 3 + 4:**
- <strong>1</strong> wild in reel 3 (middle)
- <strong>1</strong> wild in reel 4

**Option C — Reels 4 + 5:**
- <strong>2</strong> wilds in reel 4
- <strong>2</strong> wilds in reel 5

**Wild Position Check:**
| Reel | Row | Counts? |
|------|-----|---------|
| Reel 3 | Top | ❌ No (exits next spin) |
| Reel 3 | Middle/Bottom | ✅ Yes |
| Reel 4 | Top | ❌ No (exits next spin) |
| Reel 4 | Middle/Bottom | ✅ Yes |
| Reel 5 | Top | ❌ No (exits next spin) |
| Reel 5 | Middle/Bottom | ✅ Yes |

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Wilds only on **top row** (they leave next spin)
- Wilds only in reels 4 and 5 with fewer than <strong>2</strong> each
- Playing Carnival Cow, Marvelous Mouse, or Terrific Tiger (no advantage)
- Single wild in reel 4 alone

---

## STOP WHEN

- All wilds move off screen (exit from top)
- Typically <strong>1–3</strong> spins per play

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Counting top row wilds (they're gone next spin)
- Playing wrong Coin Combo variant (only Hurricane Horse and Perfect Peacock work)
- Playing loose with any wilds in reels 3-4 (line hits aren't great)
- Thinking full coin bowls mean bonus is close (bowls are cosmetic only)
- Not checking all denominations (some have additional bet levels to check)

---

## Additional Notes

**Variants with Advantage:**
- Hurricane Horse ✅
- Perfect Peacock ✅

**Variants WITHOUT Advantage:**
- Carnival Cow ❌
- Marvelous Mouse ❌
- Terrific Tiger ❌

**Coin Bowls:**
- Gold coin accumulation is **cosmetic only**
- Full bowl ≠ closer to bonus
- Game states: "accumulation of coin over time in bowls is for presentation purposes only"

**Wild Frequency:**
- Wilds appear frequently (every few spins)
- Common to find playable setups
- Investment usually <strong>1–3</strong> spins
