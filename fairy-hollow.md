## How The Advantage Works

Fairy Hollow features **wild butterflies** that persist for 3 spins:

**Mechanic:**
- Wild butterflies stick for <strong>3</strong> spins
- Counter in lower right shows spins remaining (3, 2, or 1)
- Counter of 1 = Disappears next spin (don't count)

**End2End Bookending Wilds:**
- Any 2 wilds on same row OR same reel connect
- All symbols between them turn WILD
- Example: Wild in reel 1 top + wild in reel 5 top = Full row of wilds

---

## PLAY WHEN

<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- <strong>2+</strong> active wilds anywhere
- Counter showing <strong>2</strong> or <strong>3</strong> (NOT 1)

| Wild Counter | Include? |
|--------------|----------|
| 3 | ✅ Count it |
| 2 | ✅ Count it |
| 1 | ❌ Don't count (disappears next spin) |

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Fewer than <strong>2</strong> active wilds
- All wilds have counter of 1 (disappear next spin)

---

## STOP WHEN

- All wild butterfly counters reach 0
- All wilds disappear

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Counting wilds with counter of 1 (they disappear)
- Only looking at first 3 reels (End2End makes all positions valuable)
- Expecting 3-of-a-kind to pay well (need 4+ of a kind)

---

## Additional Notes

**End2End Makes All Positions Valuable:**
- Normally focus on first 3 reels in sticky wild games
- Here: ANY position can connect via End2End feature
- Don't ignore reel 4-5 wilds

**Butterfly Wilds Mode:**
- Bet higher to play this mode
- More wild butterflies appear
- Same strategy as regular mode
- Single wilds worth less (2x cost) but more likely to land additional wilds

**Similar To:**
- Ocean Magic (higher bet = more feature symbols)
