## How The Advantage Works

Dice Seeker (Flappers & Dappers / Heroes & Villains / Viking Invasion) features **rectangles with hit points** above the reels:

**Mechanic:**
- Rectangles contain characters, credit values, treasure chests
- Each rectangle has HP counter (bottom right)
- Dice lands on reel → Number shoots up to remove HP from rectangle above
- HP reaches 0 → Win the prize

**Character Sizes:**
| Size | Dimensions | Value | Starting HP |
|------|------------|-------|-------------|
| Small | 1x1 | Low | Varies |
| Large | 2x3 | **High** | 16 |

---

## PLAY WHEN (ANY ONE)

**Option A — Single Large Character:**
- Large (2x3) character with ≤ <strong>3</strong> HP remaining

**Option B — Two Large Characters:**
- Two large (2x3) characters each with ≤ <strong>5</strong> HP remaining

| Large Character HP | Single | Two Characters |
|--------------------|--------|----------------|
| ≤ 3 HP | ✅ **Play** | ✅ **Play** |
| 4–5 HP | ❌ Skip | ✅ **Play** (if both) |
| 6+ HP | ❌ Skip | ❌ Skip |

**How to Check (Free):**
- Tap menu icon (lower left)
- Use up/down arrows to cycle bet levels
- No ticket required

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Large characters above <strong>5</strong> HP (single) or <strong>6+</strong> HP (both)
- Only small (1x1) rectangles have good values
- Chasing credit values in small 1x1 blocks (too hard to hit specific reel)

---

## STOP WHEN

- Large character defeated
- Prize pick completed
- Character HP increases or resets

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Chasing 1x1 rectangles (hard to land dice on single reel)
- Playing large characters at 6+ HP
- Picking smallest prize (need volume to even out picks)
- Not checking all denominations

---

## Additional Notes

**Why Large Characters Only:**
- 2x3 characters span 2 reels = Double dice landing chance
- 1x1 blocks require dice on specific single reel (difficult)
- Large characters contain most valuable prizes

**Prize Pick Feature:**
- After defeating large character, pick from 3 hidden prizes
- Usually: 1 large credit value + 2 smaller values
- Occasionally: Free games (4 or 8) — by far most valuable
- Prize pick can appear in smaller blocks (rare)

**Free Games Bonus:**
- Volatile payout
- 4 free games: Difficult to pass first round, may pay little
- Make it to boss round: Huge potential payout

**Game Variants:**
- Flappers & Dappers ✅
- Heroes & Villains ✅
- Viking Invasion ✅

**Free Check Method:**
1. Tap menu icon (lower left corner)
2. Use up/down arrows to cycle bet levels
3. View HP counts without inserting ticket

**Line Hits:**
- Terrible
- Most payout comes from dice feature
