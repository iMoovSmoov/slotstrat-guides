## How The Advantage Works

Upshot features **locked bonus scatters for bonus trigger**:

**Game Variants:**
- Prosperity Rising
- Brilliant 7's

**Mechanic:**
- Bonus trigger: Scatter on BOTH reels 2 AND 4
- One scatter lands → Locks for <strong>3</strong> more spins
- Locked symbols also act as wilds (bonus value even without trigger)

---

## PLAY WHEN

| Setup | Action |
|-------|--------|
| "Spin 1 of 3" showing above reel 2 or 4 | ✅ **Play** |
| "Spin 2 of 3" showing above reel 2 or 4 | ✅ **Play** |
| Icon visible on bet pad for any bet level | ✅ **Play** |

**Note:** Message disappears after spin 3 - no more locked spins.
