## How The Advantage Works

Indian Motorcycle features a **trophy collection system**:

**Mechanic:**
- Collect <strong>8</strong> gold trophies → Triggers wheel spin bonus
- Trophies only land in reel 5
- Each trophy adds 1x-5x bet to bonus award pool
- After bonus: Resets to <strong>2</strong> trophies

**Critical Strategy:**
- Trophy count is SHARED across all bet levels
- Bonus award accumulates in credits (not multipliers)
- **Always play minimum bet** to maximize value from others' higher bets

---

## ⚠️ MINIMUM BET ONLY

**Always play at minimum bet level.**
- Trophy progress shared across bet levels
- Bonus credits built on higher bets = More value at min bet

---

## PLAY WHEN

| Trophies | Bonus Credits Required | Action |
|----------|------------------------|--------|
| <strong>7</strong> | Any amount | ✅ **Play** |
| <strong>6</strong> | <strong>2000+</strong> credits | ✅ **Play** |
| <strong>5</strong> | <strong>3000+</strong> credits | ✅ **Play** |
| <strong>4</strong> | <strong>4000+</strong> credits | ✅ **Play** |
| <strong>3</strong> | <strong>5000+</strong> credits | ✅ **Play** |
| Below 3 | Any | ❌ Walk away |

**Where to Check:**
- Trophies: Count gold trophies displayed
- Bonus credits: Middle of screen above reels

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Fewer than <strong>3</strong> trophies collected
- Bonus credits don't meet threshold for trophy count
- Playing above minimum bet level

---

## STOP WHEN

- Wheel spin bonus completes
- Game resets to <strong>2</strong> trophies

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Playing above minimum bet (wastes the advantage)
- Not checking bonus credit amount (just counting trophies)
- Playing 3-6 trophies without meeting credit threshold
- Not noticing the game (look for motorcycle above machines)

---

## Additional Notes

**Why Minimum Bet Works:**
- Previous player bet high → Trophy awards built at high rate
- You play min bet → Same trophy progress, lower cost
- Bonus pays accumulated credits regardless of your bet

**Wheel Spin Outcomes:**
| Result | Frequency |
|--------|-----------|
| Base bonus award | Most common |
| 2x multiplier | Less common |
| 3x multiplier | Rare |
| 5x multiplier | Very rare |
| Motorcycle logo | Garage jackpot bonus |

**Garage Jackpot Bonus:**

- Chance to win actual Indian motorcycle

**Trophy Location:**

**Easy to Spot:**
- Replica motorcycle suspended above machines

**RTP Settings:**
- 88%, 90%, or 92% (varies by casino)
