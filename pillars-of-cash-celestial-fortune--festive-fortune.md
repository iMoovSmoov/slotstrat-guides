## How The Advantage Works

Pillars of Cash features **pillars that build credit prizes with gold dragon triggers**:

**Mechanic:**
- Coin lands → Prize added to pillar, may increase height
- 3 green dots = Spins remaining at current height
- No dots + no coin = Pillar drops one level
- Pillar hits top → Dragon turns **GOLD**
- Coin lands on gold dragon reel → Chance to win prize

**Pillar Heights for Gold Dragon:**
| Reel | Height Required | Prize Size | Difficulty |
|------|-----------------|------------|------------|
| 1, 5 | 4 high | Smallest | Easiest |
| 2, 4 | 5 high | Larger | Much harder |
| 3 | 6 high | Largest | Extremely hard |

## PLAY WHEN (ANY ONE)

**Note:** Can play gold dragons even without green dots—coin resets counter.

**Option A — Two Gold Dragons:**
- <strong>2</strong> or more gold dragons anywhere

**Option B — Single Gold Dragon (Reel 1 or 5):**
- Prize at least <strong>10x</strong> bet

**Option C — Single Gold Dragon (Reel 2 or 4):**
- Prize at least <strong>40x</strong> bet

| Setup | Prize Threshold | Action |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| 2+ gold dragons | Any | ✅ **Play** |
| 1 gold (reel 1/5) | <strong>10x+</strong> bet | ✅ **Play** |
| 1 gold (reel 2/4) | <strong>40x+</strong> bet | ✅ **Play** |
| 1 gold (reel 3) | ❌ Too difficult | Skip |

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Single gold dragon below prize threshold
- No gold dragons
- Middle reel gold dragon only (extremely difficult)

---

## STOP WHEN

- Pillar prize is awarded
- Spins expire without landing a coin

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Playing single golds without meeting prize threshold
- Thinking no green dots = can't play (coin resets it)
- Chasing middle reel gold dragons

---
