## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Progressive below percentage threshold for tier
- Top progressive at lower bet levels (poor hourly rate)

---

## STOP WHEN

- Targeted MHB jackpot triggers and resets

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Chasing top progressive at low bets (hours for small profit)
- Not checking all 5 bet levels
- Playing non-deluxe version (no MHBs)
- Not tapping "Bet Per Line" to check without money

---

## Additional Notes

**How to Check Without Money:**
- Tap "Bet Per Line" on touchscreen
- Cycles through all 5 bet levels
- No ticket required

**Quick Math for Bottom Progressive:**
- Take 10% of MHB → Cut in half → Subtract from MHB
- Example: $60 MHB → 10% = $6 → Half = $3 → Play at $57

**Hit Odds Per Spin:**
| Progressive | Odds |
|-------------|------|
| Bottom | 1 in 456 |
| Middle | 1 in 3,829 |
| Top | 1 in 58,257 |

**Top Progressive Warning:**
- Rarely worth chasing (locks you up for hours)
- Low profit especially at lower bets
- May be OK for card-building purposes

**Important Details:**
- Must play "Deluxe" version for MHBs
- Tap "Switch Games" if progressives not visible
- Progressives increase during free games too
- Usually hits near end, but can hit early

**RTP:**
- $0.50 bet: 91.420%
- $5.00 bet: 91.457%
- Difference negligible

**Game Variants:**
- Coyote Moon Deluxe ✅
- Money Storm Deluxe ✅ (loud—turn volume down)
- Lucky Larry's Lobstermania Deluxe ✅
