## How The Advantage Works

Extreme Wild: Lanterns / Stars features **coin collection for wild reels**:

**Mechanic:**
- Coin holders above reels 2, 3, and 4
- <strong>2</strong> coins collected → Reel turns wild for <strong>2</strong> spins
- Active wild = Glowing border around reel

**Visual Indicators:**
| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Glowing border | Active wild reel |
| Coins above | Spins remaining (1 or 2) |
| Built-up lanterns/stars | **FAKE** - No advantage |

---

## ⚠️ IGNORE FAKE INDICATORS

**The lanterns/stars above reels are FAKE.**
- They do NOT indicate any advantage
- Only coin collection matters

---

## PLAY WHEN

**Basic Plays:**

**Option A — Active Wilds (Reels 2-3):**
- Active wild on reel 2 or 3
- Glowing border + coins above showing spins left

**Option B — Reel 4 Setup:**
- Active wild on reel 4 with <strong>2</strong> spins remaining
- AND <strong>1</strong> coin in reel 2 or 3
- Play 1 spin to see if second coin lands (if not, stop)

**Aggressive Play:**

**Option C — Coin Setup (Slightly +EV):**
- <strong>1</strong> coin above BOTH reels 2 AND 3
- Conservative: <strong>1</strong> coin above all 3 reels

| Setup | Risk Level | Action |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Active wild reel 2 or 3 | Low | ✅ **Play** |
| Reel 4 wild (2 spins) + coin in 2/3 | Medium | ✅ **1 spin** |
| 1 coin above reels 2 AND 3 | Higher | ✅ **Play** (aggressive) |
| 1 coin above all 3 reels | Medium | ✅ **Play** (conservative) |

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- No active wilds (no glowing borders)
- Only reel 4 wild without coins elsewhere
- Only 1 coin above single reel
- RTP below 90% (aggressive play may not be +EV)

---

## STOP WHEN

- Wild spins deplete (coins above reels empty)
- Reel 4 test spin fails to land second coin

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Playing because lanterns/stars are built up (FAKE indicators)
- Playing reel 4 wilds without coin setup elsewhere
- Playing on sub-90% RTP machines (aggressive plays may be -EV)

---
