## How The Advantage Works

Block Bonanza (Hawaii / Rio) features **colored blocks** with credit values above the reels:

**Mechanic:**
- Blocks positioned above reels correspond to reel positions below
- Dollar symbol in each of first 3 reels → Win corresponding block value
- Blocks drop down after wins, replaced from top
- Over time, blocks shift down and eventually exit screen

**Block Value Hierarchy (Lowest to Highest):**
| Color | Value Rank |
|-------|------------|
| 🟣 Purple | Lowest |
| 🔵 Blue | Low |
| 🔴 Red | Medium |
| 🟢 Green | High |
| 🟡 Yellow | Highest (up to 83.3x bet) |

## PLAY WHEN (ANY ONE)

**Option A — Yellow Block:**
- Yellow block in columns <strong>1–3</strong>
- ❌ **EXCEPT:** Smallest yellow (16.6x bet)

**Option B — Value Calculation:**
- Total value of blocks in first 3 columns ≥ <strong>38x</strong> bet
- Example: $3 bet → Need $114+ total

**Quick Assessment:**
- Don't calculate if only purple/blue blocks
- Look for yellow OR multiple red/green blocks first

| What You See | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| Yellow in columns 1–3 (not smallest) | ✅ **Play** |
| Multiple red/green, total ≥38x | ✅ **Play** |
| Only purple/blue blocks | ❌ Walk away |
| Best blocks only in columns 4–5 | ❌ Walk away |

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Total value in columns 1–3 below <strong>38x</strong> bet
- Smallest yellow block only (16.6x)
- Only purple and blue blocks
- Best blocks are in columns 4–5 (too hard to hit)

---

## STOP WHEN

- Target blocks won and replaced with lower values
- Block values drop below <strong>38x</strong> threshold
- Blocks shift off screen

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Calculating value for purple/blue only boards (waste of time)
- Chasing blocks in columns 4–5 (very difficult to hit)
- Playing smallest yellow block (16.6x not worth it)
- Not understanding dollar symbols must land in sequence (reels 1-2-3)

---

## Additional Notes

**Game Variants:**
- Hawaii: Surfer symbols = dollar symbols during free games
- Rio: Extra dollar symbols added during free games
- Same result: Higher block win frequency in bonus

**Dollar Symbol Rules:**
- Must land in sequence (reel 1 → 2 → 3)
- NOT scatter symbols
- Blue diamond dollars = regular dollars + random value boost
- Can land multiple dollars per reel, but need at least 1 in each of reels 1-2-3

**Volatility Warning:**
- Extremely high variance
- Difficult to land 3 dollar symbols
- No guarantee of hitting target block
- Many wins come from free games bonus

**Column 4–5 Blocks:**
- Contain largest prizes
- Very difficult to trigger
- Not worth chasing
