## How The Advantage Works

Lucky Pick features a **21-pick board with free games bonus**:

**Mechanic:**
- Board has <strong>21</strong> covered picks above reels
- Lucky Pick symbol lands → Reveal one pick
- Picks = Credit prizes (instant) OR upgrades (for free games)
- <strong>3</strong> scatter symbols → Triggers free games bonus
- After bonus: Board resets with 3 random non-credit picks revealed

**Free Games Default Values:**
- 3 free games
- 1 random wild added to reels 2-5 each spin
- 2x multiplier on all wins

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: NEVER STOP EARLY

**Always play until free games bonus triggers.**
- Average: 6 minutes
- Worst case: Up to 30 minutes
- All equity is in the bonus—stopping early = losing value

**Bankroll Requirement:**
- Minimum <strong>600x</strong> bet size
- Example: $6 bet = $3,600 bankroll needed

---

## PLAY WHEN

### Basic Plays (Recommended for Beginners)

**Option A — Three Wilds:**
- <strong>3</strong> wilds revealed

**Option B — Two Wilds + Extras:**
- <strong>2</strong> wilds revealed PLUS any of:
  - 1 multiplier + any other upgrade
  - <strong>4+</strong> total free games revealed
  - <strong>5</strong> credit picks revealed

**Option C — One Wild + Few Picks:**
- <strong>1</strong> wild revealed
- <strong>10</strong> or fewer picks remaining

**Option D — Few Picks (Any Setup):**
- <strong>7</strong> or fewer picks remaining (regardless of what's revealed)

### Aggressive Plays (Competitive Markets / Point Building)

| Setup | Threshold |
|-------|-----------|
| 2 wilds | Any (always play) |
| 1 wild | <strong>11</strong> or fewer picks remaining |
| Any | <strong>8</strong> or fewer picks remaining |

*Note: Aggressive plays may be -EV to breakeven on low RTP, +EV on medium-high RTP.*

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- No wilds revealed + many picks remaining
- Only on Board B with no wilds (worst board)
- Insufficient bankroll for the bet level

---

## STOP WHEN

- Free games bonus triggers
- **NEVER stop before bonus** (keep playing until bonus!)

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Stopping before free games bonus (loses all equity)
- Overvaluing free games picks vs wild picks
- Playing without adequate bankroll
- Not recognizing which board you're on

## Advanced Strategy: Board Recognition

**Four Possible Boards:**

| Board | Credits | Wilds | Multipliers | Total FG | Rank |
|-------|---------|-------|-------------|----------|------|
| **C** | 9 | **3** | 2 | 10 | **Best** |
| **D** | 11 | **3** | 3 | 4 | 2nd |
| **A** | 8 | 2 | 4 | 10 | 3rd |
| **B** | 9 | 2 | 2 | 17 | **Worst** |

**Board Identification Clues:**
| You See | Board Eliminated |
|---------|------------------|
| Any +2 or +3 FG | NOT Board D |
| Multiple +2 or +3 FG | Board B |
| 10+ credits revealed | Board D |

**Why Wilds Are Critical:**
- Wilds > Multipliers > Free Games (usually)
- Goal: Enter bonus with <strong>2-3</strong> wilds revealed
- 3-wild bonus wins cover multiple losses
