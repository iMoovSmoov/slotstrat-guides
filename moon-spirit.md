## How The Advantage Works

Moon Spirit operates on a **10-game cycle with horizontally expanding wilds**:

**Mechanic:**
- <strong>10</strong> game cycle
- Frames lock during cycle
- Spin 10: ALL locked frames turn wild
- Lady symbol in frame on spin 10 → Expands wilds horizontally (left + right)

**Key Difference from Scarab:**
- More volatile final spin
- Frames on reels 2-3 much more valuable (horizontal expansion)
- Vertical stacks valuable (can expand lady symbols left/right)

## PLAY WHEN

**Frames in First 3 Reels Required (by spin):**

| Spin | Frames Needed (Reels 1-3) |
|------|---------------------------|
| 10 of 10 | ❌ Never |
| 9 of 10 | <strong>1</strong> |
| 8-7 of 10 | <strong>2</strong> |
| 6-5 of 10 | <strong>3</strong> |
| 4-3 of 10 | <strong>4</strong> |
| 2-1 of 10 | <strong>5</strong> |

**Alternative Plays (Spins 6-5):**
- <strong>2</strong> frames in reels 2 AND 3
- <strong>3</strong> horizontally connected frames starting in reel 1 or 2

**Alternative Plays (Spins 4-3):**
- <strong>3</strong> frames in reels 2 AND 3
- <strong>3</strong> horizontally connected frames starting in reel 1 or 2

**Alternative Plays (Spins 2-1):**
- <strong>4</strong> frames in reels 2 AND 3
- <strong>3</strong> horizontally connected frames starting in reel 1 or 2

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Spin 10 of 10 (too late)
- Fewer frames than threshold for spin position
- Frames only in reels 4-5 (less valuable)

---

## STOP WHEN

- 10th spin completes (frames turn wild, expansion resolves)

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Playing spin 10 of 10 (no value left)
- Not prioritizing reels 2-3 for frames
- Ignoring horizontal connection opportunities
- Treating this like Scarab (different mechanics)

## Additional Notes

**Why Reels 2-3 Are Critical:**
- Lady symbol in frame → Wilds expand left AND right
- Frame in reel 2 or 3 → Guarantees 4+ of-a-kind
- Vertical stacks in 2-3 = Multiple expansion opportunities

**Why Mid-Cycle is Valuable:**
- Payout based on full 10-game cycle average
- Starting mid-cycle = Same return potential, half the cost
- Fewer frames needed later in cycle

**Spin 9 Opportunity:**
- Almost always worth playing
- Additional frames can land on spin 10
- Instant wilds if frames land
- Low-cost +EV play

**More Unpredictable:**
- Horizontal expansion adds volatility
- Can get massive wins on spin 10
- Less predictable than Scarab
