## How The Advantage Works

Lucky Larry's Lobstermania 4 Link / Super Sally's Shrimpmania 4 Link features **Loot Awards** above reels 2, 3, and 4:

**Mechanic:**
- <strong>2</strong> coins collected → Loot Award activates
- Coins appear as sub-symbols (don't block regular symbols)
- Coins land frequently → Low investment usually

**Loot Award Types:**
| Type | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Bonus | Best | Always play if present |
| Jackpot | High variance | Can bust but huge potential |
| Others | Good | Standard awards |

---

## PLAY WHEN (ANY ONE)

**Option A — Three Reels Setup:**
- <strong>1</strong> coin in each of 3 Loot Awards (reels 2, 3, 4)
- Stop after triggering one

**Option B — Active Loot Award:**
- Shows "2 Spins Left" or "1 Spin Left"

**Option C — Bonus Loot Award:**
- Bonus present on any reel
- **Any coin count** (even 0)

**Option D — Jackpot Loot Award:**
- Jackpot present with <strong>1+</strong> coins
- (0 coins is +EV but high variance)

**Option E — Completed Awards (1 Spin Gamble):**

Play 1 spin to see if Jackpot/Bonus replaces it:
- 1 completed + 1 coin in other two
- 2 completed awards
- 3 completed awards (rare)

*(Only if completed awards are NOT Jackpot/Bonus)*

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- No coins and no special Loot Awards (Bonus/Jackpot)
- Just triggered a Loot Award (re-evaluate)

---

## STOP WHEN

- Any Loot Award triggers
- Re-evaluate remaining awards

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Not recognizing Bonus Loot Award (always play)
- Waiting for coins on Jackpot Loot Award (0 coins is +EV)
- Not checking all three Loot Award positions

---

## Additional Notes

**Excellent Hustle Game:**
- One of best new advantage games
- Ploppies don't understand it
- Common to find profitable plays

**Multiple Awards:**
- Getting 2+ Loot Awards active simultaneously = Huge wins
- Awards trigger more on higher bet levels

**Bonus Loot Award Choice:**
| Option | Volatility | Typical Result |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| Bucket bonus | Low | Solid payout |
| Free games | High | Hit or miss (0-100x) |

**Award Replacement:**
- Completed award replaced by different award
- Won't be same as previous or other active awards
- 2 completed doesn't guarantee Bonus/Jackpot appears

**Visual Cue:**
- Larry/Sally dances across screen before 2nd coin lands for Bonus/Jackpot
