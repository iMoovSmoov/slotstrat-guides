## How The Advantage Works

Blazing X features **persistent multipliers** that activate when wild symbols land:

**Mechanic:**
- Wild lands in middle reel → Activates <strong>2x</strong> multiplier for <strong>3</strong> spins
- Another wild during those spins → Multiplier increases, spins reset to <strong>3</strong>
- Multiplier progression: 2x → 3x → 5x → 10x → 25x (max)
- At 25x: Additional wilds reset spins to <strong>3</strong> (no further increase)

**Multiplier Progression:**
| Wild Hits | Multiplier | Spins |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| 1 | 2x | 3 |
| 2 | 3x | 3 |
| 3 | 5x | 3 |
| 4 | 10x | 3 |
| 5+ | 25x | 3 |

---

## PLAY WHEN

<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- Any active multiplier with <strong>1+</strong> spins remaining

**How to Check:**
- Look **directly on bet pad**
- Shows multiplier and spins remaining above each bet level

| Multiplier Active | Spins Left | Action |
|-------------------|------------|--------|
| 2x–25x | 1+ | ✅ **Play** |
| None | 0 | ❌ Walk away |

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- No active multiplier
- Spins remaining = <strong>0</strong>
- Multiplier just expired (check bet pad carefully)

---

## STOP WHEN

- Remaining spins reach <strong>0</strong>
- Multiplier resets (unless you triggered a new one)

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Not checking the bet pad for multiplier status
- Missing that multiplier expired between spins
- Not realizing wild only needs to land partially (it nudges into place)
- Walking away when 25x is active with spins remaining

---

## Additional Notes

- Small investment (typically <strong>3</strong> spins max)
