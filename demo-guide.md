## This Is a Free Demo Guide

> **Full access unlocks 111+ machine-specific guides** — each one built like this page, with real entry triggers, exit rules, and field-tested strategy notes. This demo shows you exactly what you get.

Every SlotStrat guide follows the same proven structure so you can make fast, confident decisions on the casino floor. Here is what each section means and why it matters.

## How The Advantage Works

Must-Hit-By (MHB) progressives are the most beginner-friendly advantage play category because the math is straightforward:

- The jackpot **must** trigger before reaching a posted ceiling (e.g. $200)
- As the meter climbs closer to that ceiling, the **expected value (EV) of each spin increases**
- At a high enough meter value, the EV flips positive — meaning the jackpot payout exceeds the expected cost to trigger it

**Why this matters:**
- Previous players have already funded most of the jackpot with their losses
- You step in near the ceiling and capture the final payout at a fraction of the total cost
- The ceiling is a **hard guarantee** — the jackpot cannot exceed it

**Example:**
- Minor jackpot must hit by $200, currently at $185
- At most $15 of play remains before it MUST trigger
- If your expected spin cost is $0.25, that is roughly 60 spins maximum
- 60 spins x $0.25 = $15 max cost for a $185+ payout

This is the core principle behind every MHB guide in the library.

## Understanding the "Play When" Section

The **Play When** triggers are the most important part of every guide. They tell you the exact conditions that must be true before you sit down and play.

**What to look for in real guides:**
- Specific meter thresholds (dollar amounts or percentages of the ceiling)
- Which jackpot tier matters (Minor, Major, or both)
- Denomination-specific instructions (some meters only apply at certain bet levels)
- Version-specific notes (some machines have multiple cabinet versions)

**In this demo, the Play When triggers are:**

<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- Minor jackpot at **90%+** of its Must-Hit-By ceiling
- Major jackpot at **90%+** of its ceiling
- Check ALL bet levels using the denomination menu — each has its own independent meter

**Why 90%?** This is a conservative threshold that balances profitability with availability. More aggressive players might enter at 85%, but 90% gives beginners a wider margin of safety.

---

## Understanding the "Stop When" Section

**Stop When** rules protect your bankroll. They tell you exactly when to walk away — no guessing, no chasing.

**The three types of stop rules you will see across guides:**
1. **Trigger stop** — The feature or jackpot hit. The advantage is gone. Leave immediately.
2. **Session stop-loss** — You have spent your budgeted spins without triggering. Walk away and check back later.
3. **Bankroll floor** — Your total session funds dropped below a safe threshold.

**In this demo, the Stop When rules are:**
- Jackpot triggers and meter resets to seed → The advantage is gone. Walk away.
- 60 spins without a hit → Your session budget is spent. Move on.
- Bankroll below 30x bet → Not enough runway to play safely.

**The discipline to stop is what separates advantage players from gamblers.**

## PLAY WHEN

<strong>Meter Requirements:</strong>
- Minor jackpot at **90%+** of Must-Hit-By ceiling
- Major jackpot at **90%+** of Must-Hit-By ceiling

<strong>Denomination Check:</strong>
- Open the bet-level menu to cycle through all available denominations
- Each denomination has its **own independent meter**
- A $0.25 denom may be at 95% while $1.00 is only at 60%

<strong>Best-Case Setup:</strong>
- Both Minor AND Major elevated above 90%
- Lowest available denomination (reduces cost per spin)

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Any meter below **85%** of its ceiling — not enough edge
- You cannot verify the Must-Hit-By ceiling on the machine's help screen
- Another player is already seated (never hover or pressure other players)
- You are on tilt or chasing a loss from a previous session

---

## STOP WHEN

- Must-Hit-By jackpot triggers and meter resets to seed value
- **60 spins** without a jackpot hit (session stop-loss)
- Bankroll drops below **30x** your current bet
- You feel frustrated, rushed, or impulsive — walk away every time

## Denominations and Bet Sizing

| Denomination | Min Bet | Recommended Bankroll | Notes |
|:-------------|:--------|:---------------------|:------|
| $0.01 (penny) | $0.25 | $15–$25 per session | Best for beginners; lowest variance |
| $0.02 | $0.50 | $25–$40 per session | Good balance of cost and speed |
| $0.05 | $1.00 | $50–$75 per session | Faster play; higher meter contribution |
| $0.25 | $2.00 | $100+ per session | Advanced players only |

**Tip:** Always start at the **lowest denomination** available. Check every bet level — the highest-percentage meter is your best play regardless of denom.

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- **Playing meters below 85%** — The math does not support it. Be patient.
- **Ignoring the denomination menu** — The best play might be on a bet level you did not check.
- **Staying after the jackpot triggers** — The meter resets. The edge is gone. Leave.
- **Chasing with larger bets** — Bet size does not change when the jackpot triggers. Stay disciplined.
- **Not setting a session stop-loss** — Without a hard stop, losses compound. Decide your limit before you sit down.
- **Hovering over other players** — This is against casino etiquette and can get you flagged by staff.

## What Makes a SlotStrat Guide Different

Every guide in the full library includes:

1. **Exact Play When triggers** — Machine-specific thresholds verified through field testing
2. **Exact Stop When rules** — Clear exit conditions so you never have to guess
3. **Denomination breakdowns** — Which bet levels to check and which to skip
4. **Reference screenshots** — Photos of the actual machine so you can identify it on the floor
5. **Common mistakes** — Traps that catch even experienced players
6. **Advanced strategy notes** — Edge cases, version differences, and bankroll guidance

**This demo shows the structure. Real guides fill every section with machine-specific data.**

## Additional Notes

**How to Check Meters (Free):**
1. Insert a $1 bill or small ticket
2. Use the denomination or bet-level menu to cycle through all options
3. Note the meter value and ceiling for each level
4. Hit "Cash Out" when done — you have not spent anything

**Reading the Meter:**
- Look for two numbers: the **current value** and the **Must-Hit-By ceiling**
- Example: "$185.23 / $200.00" means the meter is at 92.6% — this is playable
- If you cannot find the ceiling, check the machine's help/info screen

**Session Tracking:**
- SlotStrat members can log sessions in the Dashboard Journal
- Track which machines you played, what the meters were, and your outcomes
- Over time, this data helps you refine your personal thresholds

**Game RTP:** Varies by machine (typically 88%–94% base RTP, but MHB advantage offsets the house edge when played at the right meter levels)
