## How The Advantage Works

Wheel of Fortune 4D More Money features **cycling multipliers above reels**:

**Mechanic:**
- Multiplier above each reel (1x to 20x)
- Wild lands → Multiplier above that reel increases by 1x
- Active multiplier has border around it
- Border slides RIGHT one space each spin
- After reel 5 → Cycles back to reel 1
- After triggering → Resets to 1x next spin

**Multiplier Colors:**
| Value | Color |
|-------|-------|
| 1x-5x | Normal |
| 6x+ | **YELLOW** |

---

## PLAY WHEN (ANY ONE)

**Option A — Multiple Yellow Multipliers:**
- <strong>3+</strong> yellow multipliers (6x or higher)
- Total adds up to <strong>24x+</strong>
- Examples: 8x+8x+8x=24x ✅, 6x+6x+12x=24x ✅

**Option B — Yellow Up Next:**
- Any yellow multiplier has border directly to the left
- Play <strong>1</strong> spin only

| Setup | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 3+ yellow totaling 24x+ | ✅ **Play** |
| Yellow up next (border to left) | ✅ **1 spin** |
| Single yellow, not up next | ❌ Skip |

---

## ⚠️ RESET TIMING

**Multiplier doesn't reset immediately after win:**
- Resets on NEXT spin after triggering
- Check if last play was a win
- If yes → Multiplier will disappear

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Single yellow multiplier (even large ones)
- Takes 5 spins to cycle back - not worth the cost
- Multiplier just triggered (will reset)

---

## STOP WHEN

- After triggering one yellow multiplier

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Chasing single yellow multipliers (too many spins to cycle)
- Not checking if last play was a win (multiplier will reset)
- Playing after triggering (stop after one)

---

## Additional Notes

**Multiplier Application:**
- Active multiplier applies to ALL line wins
- Doesn't need line hit reaching that reel
- Example: Reel 5 multiplier works on 3-reel line hits

**Cycle Length:**
- 5 spins to complete full cycle
- Single yellow not worth the cost to chase
