GUIDE 1: 88 Fortunes Emperor
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Counter at 15+ (counter glows when ready) | Check each denomination separately (counter shown above 5th reel or on bet panel)

STOP PLAYING:
After free games trigger (counter resets to 8)

HOW IT WORKS:
88 Fortunes Emperor's Coins features a **must-hit-by free games counter**:

**Mechanic:**
- Counter starts at <strong>8</strong>
- Counter must trigger by <strong>18</strong>
- Gold coin symbols land on reel 5 → Counter increases
- Counter glows at <strong>15+</strong>

---

PLAY WHEN:
<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>

**Counter Location:**
- Above 5th reel (right side)
- Also visible on bet panel

- Look at bet panel to see counter for each bet level
- Check all denominations

| Counter | State | Action |
|---------|-------|--------|
| 8–13 | ❌ Cold | Walk away |
| 14 | ⚠️ Early | Risky play |
| 15+ | ✅ **Play** | Counter glows |
| 18 | 🎰 Trigger | Must hit |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Counter below <strong>15</strong>
- Counter at 13–14 (some APs play here, but not recommended)
- Free games just triggered (counter resets to 8)

---

STOP WHEN:
- Free games trigger
- Counter resets to <strong>8</strong>

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing at 13–14 (consensus is wait for 15)
- Not checking all denominations
- Not finding counter on bet panel
- Underestimating volatility (coin collection can be slow)

---

==================================================
GUIDE 2: Alien Heroes
==================================================

Category: accumulation
Volatility: medium
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
2 stars in all 3 containers (kung fu/ninja/cowboy on right side of reels) | Any active hero feature (alien with flames on top of container)

STOP PLAYING:
After triggering any hero feature (free games bonus)

HOW IT WORKS:
Alien Heroes features **scatter-based wins** with no paylines:

**Mechanic:**
- Every symbol is a scatter (no paylines)
- <strong>5+</strong> matching symbols anywhere → Win
- <strong>8</strong> matching symbols → Triggers free games
- Stars land randomly and fill containers (right side)
- <strong>3</strong> stars in container → Hero Feature activates next spin

**Three Hero Containers:**
| Hero | Feature Effect |
|------|----------------|
| Kung Fu | Merges 4 positions into 2x2 reels (upper left + bottom right) |
| Ninja | Random symbol appears in 6 positions |
| Cowboy | Locks most common symbol, respins other reels |

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — All Containers Ready:**
- All <strong>3</strong> containers have <strong>2</strong> stars each
- Kung Fu: 2 stars ✓
- Ninja: 2 stars ✓
- Cowboy: 2 stars ✓

**Option B — Active Hero Feature:**
- Alien with **flames** visible on top of any container

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Any container has fewer than <strong>2</strong> stars
- No active hero features
- Just triggered a hero feature (re-evaluate)

---

STOP WHEN:
- Any hero feature triggers
- Free games bonus completes
- Re-evaluate star counts

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing with uneven star counts (need 2 in ALL containers)
- Thinking glowing meters above reels matter (they reset every spin)
- Expecting wins during base game (nearly 0% return in base)
- Not recognizing active hero feature (flames on container)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/alien-heroes-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/alien-heroes-2.jpg
  Image 3: /images/games/alien-heroes-3.jpg - The Free Games round can swing big — it’s super volatile! Each extra matching symbol boosts your payout per spin. Fill the whole screen, and you’ll get a random multiplier added to your win.


==================================================
GUIDE 3: Aztec Banner / Pegasus Banner
==================================================

Category: multi-state
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
3+ card symbols active above reels (check spin counters below each) | 2 symbols active with 5+ spins each (verify on bet pad)

STOP PLAYING:
All card symbol activations expire (counters reach 0)

HOW IT WORKS:
Aztec Banner / Pegasus Banner features **four card symbols** above the reels:

**Mechanic:**
- 2-high banner lands fully → Activates matching card symbol for <strong>7</strong> spins
- Activated symbols that land → Transform into sliding banners
- Sliding banners reveal random matching symbols
- All 4 cards active → Massive line hit potential

**Card Symbols:**
- ♠️ Spade
- ♥️ Heart
- ♦️ Diamond
- ♣️ Club

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — Three Active (Recommended):**
- <strong>3+</strong> card symbols active above reels
- Check spin counter below each card

**Option B — Two Active (Aggressive):**
- <strong>2</strong> card symbols active
- Both have <strong>5+</strong> spins remaining
- Higher variance, but activating 3rd card covers losses

**How to Check:**
- Look at bet pad for active card count
- Spin counter visible below each card symbol

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Fewer than <strong>2</strong> card symbols active
- Only 2 active with fewer than <strong>5</strong> spins each
- All counters about to expire

---

STOP WHEN:
- All card symbol activations expire (counters reach 0)
- Re-evaluate after any banner lands

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing with only 1 active card symbol
- Playing 2 active cards with low spin counts
- Forgetting this is NOT all-ways-pay (need line hits)
- Not checking bet pad for card status

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/aztec-banner--pegasus-banner-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/aztec-banner--pegasus-banner-2.jpg
  Image 3: /images/games/aztec-banner--pegasus-banner-3.jpg - Landing the 2-high club and heart banners refreshed their counters above the reels, resetting each one back to seven spins remaining.
  Image 4: /images/games/aztec-banner--pegasus-banner-4.jpg - Even with only two card symbols active, this setup is still worth playing for a couple more spins. You’ve got a good chance to activate a third card symbol — and maybe even a fourth if you get lucky!
  Image 5: /images/games/aztec-banner--pegasus-banner-5.jpg - There are three card symbols active on the 150-credit bet, which you can easily spot right on the bet pad — a clear sign that this is a play.


==================================================
GUIDE 4: BIG OCEAN JACKPOTS
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
3+ wild bubbles anywhere except top row (ignore jackpot bubbles showing mini/minor/maxi)

STOP PLAYING:
After wild bubbles trigger (poker symbols turn wild)

HOW IT WORKS:
Big Ocean Jackpots features **bubbles** that move up the reels:

**Mechanic:**
- Bubbles move **up one position** each spin
- Bubble lands on coin symbol → Prize awarded
- **Wild bubbles** trigger → All poker symbols turn wild
- 2 wild bubbles trigger same spin → <strong>2x</strong> multiplier on wild wins

**Bubble Types:**
| Type | Contains | Chase? |
|------|----------|--------|
| Wild | Wild symbol | ✅ Yes |
| Jackpot | Mini/Minor/Maxi | ❌ No |

---

PLAY WHEN:
⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Do NOT count bubbles on top row—they exit next spin.

<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- <strong>3+</strong> wild bubbles anywhere except top row

**Why Wild Bubbles:**
- Reel position doesn't matter
- Value comes from poker symbols turning wild after trigger
- Creates cascade of wild wins

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Wild bubbles only on top row
- Fewer than <strong>3</strong> wild bubbles
- Only jackpot bubbles present (no advantage)
- Chasing maxi jackpot bubbles (too difficult to hit)

---

STOP WHEN:
- Wild bubbles trigger (poker symbols turn wild)
- All wild bubbles move off top of screen

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Counting top row bubbles (they're gone next spin)
- Chasing jackpot bubbles (mini/minor/maxi are common, no advantage)
- Chasing maxi bubbles alone (too hard to trigger)
- Confusing wild bubbles with jackpot bubbles

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/big-ocean-jackpots-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/big-ocean-jackpots-2.jpg - The wild bubbles (shown in reels two and four) are what make this game exploitable.
  Image 3: /images/games/big-ocean-jackpots-3.jpg - Landing a bubble on top of the yellow coin shown here will trigger the bubbles. As you can see, the jackpot bubbles are extremely common.
  Image 4: /images/games/big-ocean-jackpots-4.jpg - When a wild bubble lands on top of a coin, it will turn all of the poker symbols wild.


==================================================
GUIDE 5: Blazin’ Diamond / Lightning Wilds
==================================================

Category: multi-state
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
N/A

STOP PLAYING:
After Pay Upgrade spins reach 0 (check all bet levels before leaving machine)

HOW IT WORKS:
Blazin' Diamond / Lightning Wilds features a **Pay Upgrade mode**:

**Mechanic:**
- Pay Upgrade symbol lands on reel 3 → Triggers <strong>3</strong> spins
- During Pay Upgrade: All 7s and BARs pay <strong>2x</strong>
- Counter decreases each spin until 0

**Why It's Valuable:**
- Nearly ALL line hits involve 7s and BARs
- 2x multiplier significantly boosts payouts
- Low volatility (predictable outcomes)

---

PLAY WHEN:
<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- "Pay Upgrade Active" banner visible above pay table
- Spins remaining counter > 0

**How to Spot:**
| Indicator | Location |
|-----------|----------|
| "Pay Upgrade Active" banner | Middle of screen, above pay table |
| Spins remaining | Below the banner |
| Upbeat music | Plays when switching to active bet level |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- No "Pay Upgrade Active" banner visible
- Spins remaining = 0
- Feature not active on any bet level

---

STOP WHEN:
- Pay Upgrade spins reach 0
- **Check all bet levels before leaving** (may be active on different denomination)

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Not checking all bet levels/denominations
- Missing the visual cue (banner above pay table)
- Missing the audio cue (upbeat music on active level)
- Ignoring this game entirely (many APs overlook it)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/blazin-diamond--lightning-wilds-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/blazin-diamond--lightning-wilds-2.jpg - The Pay Upgrade feature is active for one more spin, and this was a solid line hit thanks to that 2x multiplier boosting the payout!
  Image 3: /images/games/blazin-diamond--lightning-wilds-3.jpg
  Image 4: /images/games/blazin-diamond--lightning-wilds-4.jpg - The progressive jackpots can only be won when playing at max bet.


==================================================
GUIDE 6: Blazing X
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Any active multiplier (2x/3x/5x/10x/25x) with 1 or more spins remaining (check bet pad above each bet level)

STOP PLAYING:
After remaining spins reach 0 (multiplier resets)

HOW IT WORKS:
Blazing X features **persistent multipliers** that activate when wild symbols land:

**Mechanic:**
- Wild lands in middle reel → Activates <strong>2x</strong> multiplier for <strong>3</strong> spins
- Another wild during those spins → Multiplier increases, spins reset to <strong>3</strong>
- Multiplier progression: 2x → 3x → 5x → 10x → 25x (max)
- At 25x: Additional wilds reset spins to <strong>3</strong> (no further increase)

**Multiplier Progression:**
| Wild Hits | Multiplier | Spins |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| 1 | 2x | 3 |
| 2 | 3x | 3 |
| 3 | 5x | 3 |
| 4 | 10x | 3 |
| 5+ | 25x | 3 |

---

PLAY WHEN:
<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- Any active multiplier with <strong>1+</strong> spins remaining

**How to Check:**
- Look **directly on bet pad**
- Shows multiplier and spins remaining above each bet level

| Multiplier Active | Spins Left | Action |
|-------------------|------------|--------|
| 2x–25x | 1+ | ✅ **Play** |
| None | 0 | ❌ Walk away |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- No active multiplier
- Spins remaining = <strong>0</strong>
- Multiplier just expired (check bet pad carefully)

---

STOP WHEN:
- Remaining spins reach <strong>0</strong>
- Multiplier resets (unless you triggered a new one)

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Not checking the bet pad for multiplier status
- Missing that multiplier expired between spins
- Not realizing wild only needs to land partially (it nudges into place)
- Walking away when 25x is active with spins remaining

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/blazing-x-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/blazing-x-2.jpg - The wild symbol landed in the middle reel and increased the multiplier to 25x. It will remain for three additional spins. Finding the game in this state is an excellent play.
  Image 3: /images/games/blazing-x-3.jpg - This play resulted in a profit of $188 in just a few spins.
  Image 4: /images/games/blazing-x-4.jpg - You can check this machine by looking directly on the bet pad. You can see the multipliers and number of chances remaining above each bet level.


==================================================
GUIDE 7: BLOCK BONANZA
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
First 3 columns total 38x+ bet | Yellow block in columns 1-3 (not the smallest 16.6x) | Multiple red/green blocks worth calculating

STOP PLAYING:
Target blocks won and replaced with lower-value blocks

HOW IT WORKS:
Block Bonanza (Hawaii / Rio) features **colored blocks** with credit values above the reels:

**Mechanic:**
- Blocks positioned above reels correspond to reel positions below
- Dollar symbol in each of first 3 reels → Win corresponding block value
- Blocks drop down after wins, replaced from top
- Over time, blocks shift down and eventually exit screen

**Block Value Hierarchy (Lowest to Highest):**
| Color | Value Rank |
|-------|------------|
| 🟣 Purple | Lowest |
| 🔵 Blue | Low |
| 🔴 Red | Medium |
| 🟢 Green | High |
| 🟡 Yellow | Highest (up to 83.3x bet) |

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — Yellow Block:**
- Yellow block in columns <strong>1–3</strong>
- ❌ **EXCEPT:** Smallest yellow (16.6x bet)

**Option B — Value Calculation:**
- Total value of blocks in first 3 columns ≥ <strong>38x</strong> bet
- Example: $3 bet → Need $114+ total

**Quick Assessment:**
- Don't calculate if only purple/blue blocks
- Look for yellow OR multiple red/green blocks first

| What You See | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| Yellow in columns 1–3 (not smallest) | ✅ **Play** |
| Multiple red/green, total ≥38x | ✅ **Play** |
| Only purple/blue blocks | ❌ Walk away |
| Best blocks only in columns 4–5 | ❌ Walk away |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Total value in columns 1–3 below <strong>38x</strong> bet
- Smallest yellow block only (16.6x)
- Only purple and blue blocks
- Best blocks are in columns 4–5 (too hard to hit)

---

STOP WHEN:
- Target blocks won and replaced with lower values
- Block values drop below <strong>38x</strong> threshold
- Blocks shift off screen

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Calculating value for purple/blue only boards (waste of time)
- Chasing blocks in columns 4–5 (very difficult to hit)
- Playing smallest yellow block (16.6x not worth it)
- Not understanding dollar symbols must land in sequence (reels 1-2-3)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/block-bonanza-hawaii-rio-1.png
  Image 2: /images/games/block-bonanza-hawaii-rio-2.jpeg - The large yellow blocks (83.3x your bet size) like this are the best possible play, but they are rare to find.
  Image 3: /images/games/block-bonanza-hawaii-rio-3.jpeg - Landing dollar symbols in all five reels always pays very well because the largest blocks are in reels four and five.
  Image 4: /images/games/block-bonanza-hawaii-rio-4.jpeg - Your block wins will often come in the free games bonus. In the Hawaii theme of Block Bonanza, the surfer symbols count as dollar symbols during the free games.
  Image 5: /images/games/block-bonanza-hawaii-rio-5.jpeg - Oftentimes you won’t hit the block you are chasing after, as happened here. But it was still a nice win, thanks to the dollar symbol in reel four.


==================================================
GUIDE 8: Blooming Penzai
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
3+ fully gold trees (green rim and gold orb on pot) | Total prizes above all 5 reels = 100x+ bet (spread across multiple reels preferred)

STOP PLAYING:
After Blooming Gold feature triggers and awards prizes (trees reset to green shrubs)

HOW IT WORKS:
Blooming Penzai features **credit prizes and trees** above each reel:

**Mechanic:**
- Coin with value lands → Prize above that reel increases
- Prize grows → Tree turns gold
- Gold tree symbol lands (during bonus) → Win prize above
- Prize awarded → Resets to 1x bet, tree shrinks to green shrub

**Tree Progression:**
- Tree turns **fully gold** at ~<strong>20x</strong> bet value
- Fully gold = Green rim + gold orb on pot

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — Total Value:**
- Total prizes above all 5 reels ≥ <strong>100x</strong> bet
- Prizes should be **spread across multiple reels** (lowers variance)

**Option B — Gold Tree Count:**
- <strong>3+</strong> fully gold trees
- Look for: Green rim + gold orb on pot

**Option C — Four Gold Trees:**
- <strong>4</strong> fully gold trees
- Almost always a play
- ❌ **EXCEPT:** All 4 recently turned gold (low prize values)

| Gold Trees | Total Value | Action |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| 0–2 | Below 100x | ❌ Walk away |
| 3+ | Any | ✅ **Play** |
| Any | 100x+ bet | ✅ **Play** |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Total prizes below <strong>100x</strong> bet with fewer than 3 gold trees
- Single massive prize (not spread out = high variance)
- Just triggered Blooming Gold (prizes reset)

---

STOP WHEN:
- Blooming Gold feature triggers and completes
- Trees reset to green shrubs
- Prize totals drop below threshold

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Chasing single large prize (need spread for lower variance)
- Not checking all 5 reels for total value
- Not recognizing fully gold tree (green rim + gold orb)
- Not checking all denominations

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/blooming-penzai-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/blooming-penzai-2.jpg - The prizes above the five reels add up to approximately 100x the bet, so this is a solid play.
  Image 3: /images/games/blooming-penzai-3.jpg - Landing a gold tree symbol during the Blooming Gold free games feature will award the prize above that reel.
  Image 4: /images/games/blooming-penzai-4.jpg - This is an amazing play with a ton of built-up equity. The total value of the prizes is 239x the bet level.
  Image 5: /images/games/blooming-penzai-5.jpg - The coin symbol in the first reel added enough equity to the prize to turn the tree above fully golden.
  Image 6: /images/games/blooming-penzai-6.jpg - You will usually trigger several prizes during the Blooming Gold feature, so it can pay very well when enough equity has accrued.


==================================================
GUIDE 9: Bubble Blast / Spells ’N Whistles / Trials of Atlantis
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Total bubble values 5x+ bet size (exclude top row - those leave next spin) | Check below bottom row for incoming bubbles

STOP PLAYING:
After bubbles collected and total remaining value drops below 5x bet

HOW IT WORKS:
Bubble Blast / Spells 'N Whistles / Trials of Atlantis features **persistent bubbles** with credit values:

**Mechanic:**
- Bubbles with credit values appear on reels
- Each spin → Bubbles move **up one row**
- Bubble lands on "catcher" symbol → Win credit value
- Bubbles can be triggered **multiple times** (don't disappear)

---

PLAY WHEN:
⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Do NOT count bubbles on top row—they leave next spin.

<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- Total bubble credit value ≥ <strong>5x</strong> bet size
- Example: $5 bet → Need $25+ in bubble values

**Also Check:**
- Bubbles below bottom row (moving into play next spin)
- If credit value obscured → Play anyway to reveal it

**Bubble Position Check:**
| Row | Counts Toward Total? |
|-----|---------------------|
| Top row | ❌ No (exits next spin) |
| Middle rows | ✅ Yes |
| Bottom row | ✅ Yes |
| Below bottom | ✅ Yes (incoming) |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Total bubble value below <strong>5x</strong> bet
- Only bubbles on top row
- No bubbles visible

---

STOP WHEN:
- Bubbles collected and remaining total drops below <strong>5x</strong> bet
- All bubbles move off top of screen

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Counting top row bubbles (they're gone next spin)
- Not checking below bottom row for incoming bubbles
- Not checking all denominations

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/bubble-blast-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/bubble-blast-2.jpg - The bubbles with credit values are awarded when they land on top of the blue portal “catcher” symbols. This is a solid play with the total value of both bubbles at $5, which is 10x the bet size.
  Image 3: /images/games/bubble-blast-3.jpg - The Mini and Maxi jackpots can also appear inside the bubbles.
  Image 4: /images/games/bubble-blast-4.jpg - Bubbles can appear below the reels and will move into play next spin.


==================================================
GUIDE 10: BUBBLE MANIA
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Total bubble values 5x+ bet (exclude top row) | Any giant bubble (2+ reels wide) regardless of value | Check below bottom row for incoming bubbles

STOP PLAYING:
All bubbles move off top of screen with no valuable bubbles remaining below

HOW IT WORKS:
Bubble Mania (Potion Pays / Hai Long / Fizzy Frenzy) features **persistent bubbles** with credit values:

**Mechanic:**
- Bubbles with credit values appear on reels
- Each spin → Bubbles move **up one row**
- Bubble lands on special symbol → Win credit value
- Bubbles can be triggered **multiple times** (don't disappear)

---

PLAY WHEN:
⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Do NOT count bubbles on top row—they leave next spin.

**Option A — Total Value:**
- Total bubble credit value ≥ <strong>5x</strong> bet size
- Example: $3.75 bet → Need $18.75+ in bubble values

**Option B — Giant Bubbles:**
- Any giant bubble (2+ reels wide)
- Play regardless of credit value
- Giant bubbles = 2, 3, or 4 reels wide

**Option C — Hidden Bubbles:**
- Bubbles visible below bottom row
- Credit value obscured → Play anyway to see value

**Bubble Position Check:**
| Row | Counts Toward Total? |
|-----|---------------------|
| Top row | ❌ No (exits next spin) |
| Middle rows | ✅ Yes |
| Bottom row | ✅ Yes |
| Below bottom | ✅ Yes (check for incoming) |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Total bubble value below <strong>5x</strong> bet (no giant bubbles)
- Only bubbles on top row
- No bubbles visible

---

STOP WHEN:
- All bubbles move off top of screen
- No valuable bubbles remaining below bottom row

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Counting top row bubbles (they're gone next spin)
- Not checking below bottom row for incoming bubbles
- Missing giant bubbles (always play regardless of value)
- Not using free check method (tap bet level)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/bubble-mania-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/bubble-mania-2.jpg - This is a solid play with the total value of both bubbles at $8, which is 10.6x the value of the bet.
  Image 3: /images/games/bubble-mania-3.jpg - Landing a bubble on top of the crystal ball symbol awards the credit value inside the bubble. Bubbles often come in clumps like you see on the bottom row.
  Image 4: /images/games/bubble-mania-4.jpg - This is an excellent play on the Hai Long version with the total bubble values worth 26x the bet.
  Image 5: /images/games/bubble-mania-5.jpg - Bubbles can appear below the bottom row, moving up the next spin. If the credit value on an upcoming bubble is obscured like this, I recommend just playing anyway to see what it is.
  Image 6: /images/games/bubble-mania-6.jpg - Giant bubbles like these are always worth playing, as you have more opportunities to trigger them (and you can trigger them more than once).
  Image 7: /images/games/bubble-mania-7.jpg - On Fizzy Frenzy, be on the lookout for green glowing bubbles like the one in the fifth reel—these move around randomly until triggered.


==================================================
GUIDE 11: BUFFALO LINK
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Buffalo head counter at 1610+ (green text above 5th reel) | Use $1 bill trick to check all bet levels without spinning

STOP PLAYING:
After hold & spin or free games feature triggers (counter resets to 100)

HOW IT WORKS:
Buffalo Link features a must-hit-by counter that:
- Starts at <strong>100</strong>
- Must trigger before reaching <strong>1800</strong>
- Accumulates approximately <strong>1.7</strong> buffalo heads per spin

The feature triggers randomly between 100–1800, awarding either:
- **Hold & Spin feature** (more consistent payouts)
- **8 Free Games feature** (high variance, potential for retriggers)

---

PLAY WHEN:
<strong>Counter Requirements:</strong>
- Counter ≥ <strong>1610</strong>
- Counter displayed in **green text** above the 5th reel

<strong>Location:</strong>
- Check the counter above the **fifth reel**
- Use $1 bill trick to check all bet levels without spinning

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** This threshold is conservative. Some APs play at 1350+, but data supports 1610+ for consistent profitability.

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Counter below <strong>1610</strong>
- You are chasing losses from a previous session
- Counter is between 1000–1600 (common trap for inexperienced players)
- You cannot afford the variance (this game is extremely volatile)

---

STOP WHEN:
- Hold & Spin feature triggers (counter resets to 100)
- Free Games feature triggers (counter resets to 100)
- Bankroll loss exceeds your predetermined limit

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing at counters below 1610 expecting profitability
- Chasing the Grand jackpot (requires filling all 20 positions—extremely rare)
- Getting excited at 19/20 buffalos (common tease pattern)
- Basing play decisions on Major jackpot size (jackpot hits too rarely to matter)
- Continuing after feature triggers (counter resets)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/buffalo-link-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/buffalo-link-2.jpg - The free feature triggers at a random point between 100 and 1800, so it is rare to find the counter this high.
  Image 3: /images/games/buffalo-link-3.jpg - Line hits can occasionally pay out handsomely, even on lower bets.


==================================================
GUIDE 12: Cai Fu Long
==================================================

Category: accumulation
Volatility: medium
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Must show

STOP PLAYING:
After coins turn wild on final spin | After hold & spin feature completes (if 6 coins triggered it)

HOW IT WORKS:
Cai Fu Long features **coin collection** that turns wild or triggers hold & spin:

**Mechanic:**
- Coins land and lock for <strong>3</strong> spins
- New coin lands → Counter resets to <strong>3</strong>
- <strong>6</strong> coins collected → Hold & spin feature
- Fewer than 6 coins → **Coins turn wild on final spin**

---

PLAY WHEN:
**BONUS BOOST Bets** (labeled on bet pad):

| Coins | Requirement | Action |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | — | ❌ Never play |
| 2 | At least 1 coin in reels 1–3 | ✅ Play |
| 3+ | — | ✅ Always play |

**NON-BONUS BOOST Bets** (labeled on bet pad):

| Coins | Requirement | Action |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | — | ❌ Never play |
| 2 | 2 coins in reels 1–3, **different reels** | ✅ Play |
| 3 | At least 1 coin in reels 1–3 | ✅ Play |
| 4+ | — | ✅ Always play |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Shows "0 spins left" above reels
- Only 1 coin locked
- 2 coins but none in reels 1–3 (Bonus Boost)
- 2 coins in same reel within reels 1–3 (Non-Boost)

---

STOP WHEN:
- Coins turn wild on final spin
- Hold & spin feature completes (if 6 coins triggered it)

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Not checking "spins left" counter above reels
- Playing 1-coin state (never +EV)
- Confusing Bonus Boost vs Non-Boost requirements
- Not noticing coin positions (reels 1–3 matter)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/cai-fu-long-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/cai-fu-long-2.jpg - Only one more coin is needed to trigger the hold & spin feature. But even if you don’t trigger the feature here, the three coins in a row will give a nice line hit when the coins turn wild.
  Image 3: /images/games/cai-fu-long-3.jpg - This was a solid line hit with the five wild coins on the final spin.

GUIDE 13: Captain Riches / Tiki Fortune / Mine Blast
==================================================

Category: accumulation
Volatility: medium
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Active wild on reel 2 or 3 (glowing gold border with coins above showing spins remaining) | Active wild on reel 4 only if 2x or 3x multiplier coins are above

STOP PLAYING:
After wild spins complete (coins above deplete to 0)

HOW IT WORKS:
Captain Riches / Tiki Fortune / Mine Blast features **coin holders** above reels 2, 3, and 4:

**Mechanic:**
- Collect 3 coins in holder → Reel turns wild for <strong>3</strong> spins
- Active wild = Glowing gold border + coins showing spins remaining
- Coins deplete each spin until wild expires

⚠️ **AP TRAP WARNING:** This game is designed to trick players. Understand the mechanics before playing.

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Active Wild in Reel 2 or 3:**
- Glowing gold border around reel ✓
- Coins visible above showing spins remaining ✓
- ❌ If gold border but NO coins above → Do NOT play

**Active Wild in Reel 4:**
- Only if multiplier coins (2x or 3x) visible above that reel
- Regular coins in reel 4 = Not worth it

| Reel | Active Wild | Multiplier Coins | Action |
|------|-------------|------------------|--------|
| 2 | ✅ Yes | Any | ✅ **Play** |
| 3 | ✅ Yes | Any | ✅ **Play** |
| 4 | ✅ Yes | 2x or 3x | ✅ **Play** |
| 4 | ✅ Yes | None | ❌ Skip |
| Any | Gold border only | — | ❌ Skip |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Only 2 coins above any reel (NOT active wild)
- Gold border but no coins above
- Reel 4 active but no multiplier coins
- Chasing treasure chests/tiki heads (cosmetic only)

---

STOP WHEN:
- Wild spins complete (coins above deplete to 0)
- No active wilds remaining

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing 2/3 coins thinking it's close (3rd coin is rigged to be rare)
- Thinking treasure chests = closer to jackpot (purely cosmetic)
- Playing reel 4 wilds without multipliers
- Playing gold border with no coins above
- Chasing jackpots (not must-hit-by)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/captain-riches--tiki-fortune--mine-blast-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/captain-riches--tiki-fortune--mine-blast-2.jpg - The middle reel has one active wild remaining (with a 2x multiplier). The fourth reel doesn’t have any active wilds remaining.
  Image 3: /images/games/captain-riches--tiki-fortune--mine-blast-3.jpg - I recommend only playing wilds in the fourth reel if they contain multiplier coins like this. And remember that having more treasure chests unlocked doesn’t mean that the bonus is more likely to hit
  Image 4: /images/games/captain-riches--tiki-fortune--mine-blast-4.jpg - Mine Blast is a newer clone of Captain Riches and Tiki Fortune—it plays exactly the same.


==================================================
GUIDE 14: CASH FALLS
==================================================

Category: accumulation
Volatility: medium
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Reel 3, 4, or 5 is 1 coin away from full | Both reels 1 and 2 are 1 coin away | Advanced: total value of coins in 1-away reels is 6x+ bet (look for glowing blue outlines on bet pad)

STOP PLAYING:
After reel fills and awards prizes | Spin counter reaches 0

HOW IT WORKS:
Cash Falls features **coin collection** on each reel:

**Mechanic:**
- Coins with credit prizes land in reels
- Coin landing → Spin counter appears (starts at <strong>3</strong>)
- New coin in same reel → Counter resets to <strong>3</strong>
- Fill entire reel before counter hits 0 → **Win all coin values**

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — Simple (Recommended):**
- Reel <strong>3</strong>, <strong>4</strong>, or <strong>5</strong> is <strong>1</strong> coin away from full

**Option B — Combined Reels 1+2:**
- Reel <strong>1</strong> is <strong>1</strong> coin away **AND**
- Reel <strong>2</strong> is <strong>1</strong> coin away

**Option C — Advanced (Value-Based):**
- Add up all coin values in reels that are <strong>1</strong> coin away
- Total ≥ <strong>6x</strong> bet size → Play

**Option D — Aggressive (2 Coins Away):**
- Total coin value ≥ <strong>25x</strong> bet size → Play
- Only for reels <strong>2</strong> coins away

**How to Check Quickly:**
- Look at bet pad for **glowing blue outlines**
- Blue outline = that bet level has a reel 1 coin away

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Only reel <strong>1</strong> or reel <strong>2</strong> alone is 1 away
- Reels need <strong>3+</strong> coins to fill (even with big values)
- Total coin value below <strong>6x</strong> bet
- Spin counter already at <strong>1</strong> (limited chances)

---

STOP WHEN:
- Reel fills and awards prizes
- Spin counter reaches <strong>0</strong>
- All playable reels expire

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing single reel 1 or 2 that's one away (not enough value)
- Chasing reels needing 3+ coins (rarely works out)
- Not checking the bet pad for blue outlines
- Missing that you triggered a different reel accidentally
- Not checking all denominations

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/cash-falls-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/cash-falls-2.jpg - *The bet pad will have glowing blue outlines around the bet levels that contain reels that are one coin away.
  Image 3: /images/games/cash-falls-3.jpg - This is a solid play with two reels that are one coin away.
  Image 4: /images/games/cash-falls-4.jpg - Having three reels that are one coin away is always a play.
  Image 5: /images/games/cash-falls-5.jpg - I had three chances to land one more coin to fill reel five, where I would have won $791. Unfortunately, it didn’t work out (which is often the case with this game).
  Image 6: /images/games/cash-falls-6.jpg - First and second reels that are one coin away like this are rarely worth playing.
  Image 7: /images/games/cash-falls-7.jpeg - That’s a newer version that is a little different. The fire link balls are valued at roughly 35x, so you can be a bit more aggressive chasing those.


==================================================
GUIDE 15: COIN COMBO
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
2 wilds in reel 3 (middle) | 1 wild in reel 3 + 1 wild in reel 4 | 2 wilds each in reels 4 and 5 (exclude top row wilds - they leave next spin)

STOP PLAYING:
After all wilds move off screen (exit from top row)

HOW IT WORKS:
Coin Combo: Hurricane Horse / Perfect Peacock features **persistent wilds** on reels 3, 4, and 5:

**Mechanic:**
- Wilds randomly appear on reels 3, 4, and 5
- Each spin → Wilds move **up one row**
- Wilds exit screen from top row
- Hurricane Horse: Purple Chinese character wilds
- Perfect Peacock: Blue peacock wilds (says "WILD")

---

PLAY WHEN:
⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Do NOT count wilds on the top row—they leave next spin.

**Option A — Reel 3 (Middle):**
- <strong>2</strong> wilds in reel 3 (middle reel)

**Option B — Reels 3 + 4:**
- <strong>1</strong> wild in reel 3 (middle)
- <strong>1</strong> wild in reel 4

**Option C — Reels 4 + 5:**
- <strong>2</strong> wilds in reel 4
- <strong>2</strong> wilds in reel 5

**Wild Position Check:**
| Reel | Row | Counts? |
|------|-----|---------|
| Reel 3 | Top | ❌ No (exits next spin) |
| Reel 3 | Middle/Bottom | ✅ Yes |
| Reel 4 | Top | ❌ No (exits next spin) |
| Reel 4 | Middle/Bottom | ✅ Yes |
| Reel 5 | Top | ❌ No (exits next spin) |
| Reel 5 | Middle/Bottom | ✅ Yes |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Wilds only on **top row** (they leave next spin)
- Wilds only in reels 4 and 5 with fewer than <strong>2</strong> each
- Playing Carnival Cow, Marvelous Mouse, or Terrific Tiger (no advantage)
- Single wild in reel 4 alone

---

STOP WHEN:
- All wilds move off screen (exit from top)
- Typically <strong>1–3</strong> spins per play

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Counting top row wilds (they're gone next spin)
- Playing wrong Coin Combo variant (only Hurricane Horse and Perfect Peacock work)
- Playing loose with any wilds in reels 3-4 (line hits aren't great)
- Thinking full coin bowls mean bonus is close (bowls are cosmetic only)
- Not checking all denominations (some have additional bet levels to check)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/coin-combo-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/coin-combo-2.jpg - **Some of the denominations have extra plays you can check—a lot of others don’t bother to cycle through all of these.
  Image 3: /images/games/coin-combo-3.jpg - This is a solid play with one wild each in reels three, four and five. The empty blue coin bowl on the left is just as likely to hit as the full green bowl on the right.
  Image 4: /images/games/coin-combo-4.jpg - The glowing purple Chinese characters function as wilds. I would skip this play with two wilds in reel four, especially on a large bet
  Image 5: /images/games/coin-combo-5.jpg - The bonus feature can pay very well, especially if you trigger multiple bowls of coins at once.
  Image 6: /images/games/coin-combo-6.jpg - Don’t shy away from the higher denoms if you have the bankroll—you have the potential for big wins such as this, while your investment is usually just one or two spins.
  Image 7: /images/games/coin-combo-7.jpg - This is another solid win on a high denom bet.
  Image 8: /images/games/coin-combo-8.jpg - This is an excellent walk-up play that has the potential for a big win.


==================================================
GUIDE 16: Colossal Titans
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Active multipliers totaling 12x+ (count only those with spins remaining) | Meters ~75% full

STOP PLAYING:
When all active multipliers deplete (no spins remaining)

HOW IT WORKS:
Colossal Titans features **eight meters** above the reels for each symbol:

**Mechanic:**
- Lightning bolt lands on reel 3 → Randomly fills meter(s)
- Meter fills completely → Activates multiplier for <strong>9</strong> spins
- Multiplier applies to all line hits with that symbol
- Winning line hit → Resets spins remaining to <strong>9</strong>

**Multiplier Values (Left to Right):**
| Position | Multiplier |
|----------|------------|
| 1st symbol | 6x |
| 2nd symbol | 5x |
| 3rd symbol | 4x |
| 4th–8th symbols | 3x each |

---

PLAY WHEN:
<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- Active multipliers total ≥ <strong>12x</strong>
- Only count multipliers with <strong>1+</strong> spins remaining

**Aggressive Play:**
- Total slightly below 12x BUT
- Meters ~<strong>75%</strong> full (will activate soon)

| Active Multiplier Total | Action |
|------------------------|--------|
| Below 12x (no near-full meters) | ❌ Walk away |
| Below 12x (75%+ meters filling) | ⚠️ Playable |
| 12x+ | ✅ **Play** |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Active multipliers below <strong>12x</strong> total
- No meters close to filling
- Perpetually chasing small multipliers (trap)

---

STOP WHEN:
- All active multipliers deplete (no spins remaining)
- Total active drops below <strong>12x</strong>

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing any active multiplier (need <strong>12x+</strong> total)
- Getting tricked into perpetually chasing small multipliers
- Not counting only multipliers with spins remaining
- Forgetting to check meter fill levels

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/colossal-titans-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/colossal-titans-2.jpg - The lightning bolt sub-symbol landed in reel three and randomly charged some of the meters above. This is an excellent play with the multipliers totaling 18x.
  Image 3: /images/games/colossal-titans-3.jpg - The Zeus symbol had a 6x multiplier applied to it.
  Image 4: /images/games/colossal-titans-4.jpg - Like most IGT games, the free spins bonus is difficult to trigger but usually pays well.


==================================================
GUIDE 17: Crush Conquest / Crush Dynasty
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
CONQUEST: Pink boulder in front or within first 3 positions of queue (left or right) | DYNASTY: White boulder in front or within first 3 positions of queue (left or right)

STOP PLAYING:
After premium boulder breaks and reveals prize

HOW IT WORKS:
Crush Conquest / Crush Dynasty features **boulder crushing** (no reels):

**Mechanic:**
- Each spin = 1 hit to current boulder
- Boulder breaks after random number of hits → Reveals credit prize
- New boulder rolls in from queue (left or right, 50/50)
- Queue visible on both sides (5 boulders each)

**Premium Boulders (Worth Playing):**
| Game | Premium Boulder |
|------|-----------------|
| Crush Conquest | **Pink** |
| Crush Dynasty | **White** |

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Crush Conquest:**
- **Pink** boulder in front OR within first <strong>3</strong> positions of queue (left or right)

**Crush Dynasty:**
- **White** boulder in front OR within first <strong>3</strong> positions of queue (left or right)

| Position | Action |
|----------|--------|
| In front (being crushed) | ✅ **Play** |
| Position 1-3 in queue | ✅ **Play** |
| Position 4-5 in queue | ❌ Too far back |
| No premium visible | ❌ Walk away |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- No premium boulder (pink/white) in front or first 3 queue positions
- Only common boulders visible
- Premium boulder is position 4+ in queue

---

STOP WHEN:
- Premium boulder breaks and reveals prize

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Thinking cracks = closer to breaking (NOT TRUE)
- Playing non-premium boulders (prizes too small)
- Chasing premium boulders too far back in queue
- Not understanding 50/50 left/right boulder selection

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/crush-conquest--crush-dynasty-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/crush-conquest--crush-dynasty-2.jpg - Boulders with a lot of cracks like this are not any more likely to break on the next spin.
  Image 3: /images/games/crush-conquest--crush-dynasty-3.jpg - The pink boulder is the premium boulder in Crush Conquest. This is a solid play because it is within the first three positions of the queue.
  Image 4: /images/games/crush-conquest--crush-dynasty-4.jpg - The white boulder (shown in the back of the queue on the right) is the premium boulder in Crush Dynasty. This one was a little too far back to chase after.


==================================================
GUIDE 18: CYBER DRAGON
==================================================

Category: cycle-based
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
7 of 8 segments filled around yin-yang symbol (flames visible when 5+ filled) | 6 of 8 segments is playable but higher variance

STOP PLAYING:
After bonus wheel spins and segments reset to 0

HOW IT WORKS:
Cyber Dragon features a **yin-yang meter** with 8 segments above the reels:

**Mechanic:**
- Land 2 yin-yang symbols in correct positions → Fills 1 segment
- <strong>8</strong> segments filled → Bonus wheel spin
- Flames appear after <strong>5</strong> segments filled

---

PLAY WHEN:
<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- Segments filled: <strong>7</strong> of 8

**Aggressive Play (Higher Variance):**
- Segments filled: <strong>6</strong> of 8
- Only if comfortable with high volatility

**How to Check (Free):**
- Tap menu icon (lower left)
- Use up/down arrows to cycle bet levels
- No ticket required

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Fewer than <strong>6</strong> segments filled
- Flames showing but only 5 segments (flames ≠ playable)
- You cannot handle high variance losses
- Just triggered bonus wheel (segments reset)

---

STOP WHEN:
- Bonus wheel spins
- Segments reset to <strong>0</strong>

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing at 5 segments (too early, even with flames)
- Thinking flames mean it's playable (flames at 5, +EV at 7)
- Not checking rules screen for yin-yang landing positions
- Not using free check method (menu → arrows)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/cyber-dragon-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/cyber-dragon-3.jpg - Seven of the eight segments are filled, which is a great situation. I would still play when it's 6 of 8, but be mindful that the game is extremely high volatility.
  Image 3: /images/games/cyber-dragon-4.jpg - Not all Wheel features will pay well. This game can have high volatility.

==================================================
GUIDE 19: Dancing Drums
==================================================

Category: multi-state
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
3+ fu bat symbols active above the reels

STOP PLAYING:
After bonus feature triggers and completes (fu bats reset)

HOW IT WORKS:
Dancing Drums features **persistent fu bat symbols** displayed above the reels:

**Mechanic:**
- Fu bat lands on reel → Activates position above that reel
- Activations **persist across spins**
- Collect enough fu bats → Trigger bonus feature
- After feature → Fu bats **reset**

---

PLAY WHEN:
<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- Fu bats active: ≥ <strong>3</strong> symbols lit above reels

<strong>Optimal Conditions:</strong>
- Fu bats distributed across **different reels** (increases coverage)
- More fu bats = better odds of quick trigger

<strong>Aggressive Play (Higher Variance):</strong>
- <strong>2</strong> fu bats in favorable positions
- Only if comfortable with extended play

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Fu bat activations are typically independent of bet size. Verify on specific version.

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Fewer than <strong>2</strong> fu bats active
- Fu bats clustered on same reel (poor coverage)
- Feature just triggered (fu bats reset)
- You are chasing progressive jackpots (not must-hit-by)

---

STOP WHEN:
- Bonus feature triggers and completes
- Fu bats reset after feature
- Bankroll loss exceeds predetermined limit
- 50+ spins without additional fu bat activations

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Chasing progressive jackpots (Grand/Major/Minor/Mini are NOT must-hit-by)
- Playing immediately after feature triggers (fu bats reset)
- Not checking fu bat positions before sitting down
- Expecting fu bats to appear during bonus feature (they only appear in base game)
- Playing low fu bat counts hoping to "build up"

==================================================
GUIDE 20: Dawn of Ra / Sun of Ra
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Yellow pyramid indicators lit below reel 3, 4, or 5 (shows persistent pyramid stack with spins remaining)

STOP PLAYING:
After all pyramid indicator spins deplete (all indicators empty)

HOW IT WORKS:
Dawn of Ra / Sun of Ra features **persistent pyramid stacks**:

**Mechanic:**
- Sun OR pyramid symbol in ALL 5 reels → Awards credit prizes
- Full stack of pyramids lands in reel 3, 4, or 5 → Persists for <strong>3</strong> spins
- Pyramids also function as wilds

**Pyramid Value by Reel:**
| Reel | Jackpot Potential | Credit Prize Range |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Reel 3 | Mini, Minor | Smaller |
| Reel 4 | Major | Larger |
| Reel 5 | Grand | Largest |

---

PLAY WHEN:
<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- Yellow pyramid indicators lit below reel 3, 4, or 5

**How to Check:**
- Look at indicator lights BELOW reels 3, 4, and 5
- Filled yellow pyramids = Active persistent stack
- More filled = More spins remaining

| Indicator State | Action |
|-----------------|--------|
| 1+ pyramids filled (reel 3, 4, or 5) | ✅ **Play** |
| All indicators empty | ❌ Walk away |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- No yellow pyramid indicators lit
- All pyramid indicator spins depleted

---

STOP WHEN:
- All pyramid indicator spins deplete
- All indicators become empty

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Not checking indicators below reels 3, 4, 5
- Missing the yellow pyramid fill state
- Not understanding higher reels = bigger prizes

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/dawn-of-ra--sun-of-ra-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/dawn-of-ra--sun-of-ra-2.jpg - A full stack of pyramids landed in reel three, so the entire stack will persist in that reel for three additional spins (notice the filled-in indicators below the reel).
  Image 3: /images/games/dawn-of-ra--sun-of-ra-3.jpg - The sun symbols in reels one, two, three and five, combined with the persistent pyramid stack in reel four, triggered the credit prizes.
  Image 4: /images/games/dawn-of-ra--sun-of-ra-4.jpg - The rules screen shows that reels four and five can contain much larger credit prizes compared to reel three.


==================================================
GUIDE 21: Demo Guide — How SlotStrat Works
==================================================

Category: must-hit-by
Volatility: low
Min Bet: $0.25

LOOK FOR:
Minor jackpot at 90%+ of its Must-Hit-By ceiling (e.g. $180+ out of $200 max) | Major jackpot at 90%+ of ceiling (e.g. $900+ out of $1,000 max) | Use the bet-level menu to check all denominations — each has its own meter | Prioritize machines where BOTH Minor and Major are elevated

STOP PLAYING:
After ANY must-hit-by jackpot triggers and the meter resets to its seed value | After 60 spins without a jackpot hit (session stop-loss) | If your bankroll drops below 30x your current bet level

HOW IT WORKS:
Must-Hit-By (MHB) progressives are the most beginner-friendly advantage play category because the math is straightforward:

- The jackpot **must** trigger before reaching a posted ceiling (e.g. $200)
- As the meter climbs closer to that ceiling, the **expected value (EV) of each spin increases**
- At a high enough meter value, the EV flips positive — meaning the jackpot payout exceeds the expected cost to trigger it

**Why this matters:**
- Previous players have already funded most of the jackpot with their losses
- You step in near the ceiling and capture the final payout at a fraction of the total cost
- The ceiling is a **hard guarantee** — the jackpot cannot exceed it

**Example:**
- Minor jackpot must hit by $200, currently at $185
- At most $15 of play remains before it MUST trigger
- If your expected spin cost is $0.25, that is roughly 60 spins maximum
- 60 spins x $0.25 = $15 max cost for a $185+ payout

This is the core principle behind every MHB guide in the library.

---

PLAY WHEN:
<strong>Meter Requirements:</strong>
- Minor jackpot at **90%+** of Must-Hit-By ceiling
- Major jackpot at **90%+** of Must-Hit-By ceiling

<strong>Denomination Check:</strong>
- Open the bet-level menu to cycle through all available denominations
- Each denomination has its **own independent meter**
- A $0.25 denom may be at 95% while $1.00 is only at 60%

<strong>Best-Case Setup:</strong>
- Both Minor AND Major elevated above 90%
- Lowest available denomination (reduces cost per spin)

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Any meter below **85%** of its ceiling — not enough edge
- You cannot verify the Must-Hit-By ceiling on the machine's help screen
- Another player is already seated (never hover or pressure other players)
- You are on tilt or chasing a loss from a previous session

---

STOP WHEN:
- Must-Hit-By jackpot triggers and meter resets to seed value
- **60 spins** without a jackpot hit (session stop-loss)
- Bankroll drops below **30x** your current bet
- You feel frustrated, rushed, or impulsive — walk away every time

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- **Playing meters below 85%** — The math does not support it. Be patient.
- **Ignoring the denomination menu** — The best play might be on a bet level you did not check.
- **Staying after the jackpot triggers** — The meter resets. The edge is gone. Leave.
- **Chasing with larger bets** — Bet size does not change when the jackpot triggers. Stay disciplined.
- **Not setting a session stop-loss** — Without a hard stop, losses compound. Decide your limit before you sit down.
- **Hovering over other players** — This is against casino etiquette and can get you flagged by staff.

GUIDE 22: DIAMOND COLLECTOR
==================================================

Category: accumulation
Volatility: medium
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
12 or more diamonds collected (check bet pad counter for each bet level)

STOP PLAYING:
After free spins bonus triggers (diamonds reset to zero)

HOW IT WORKS:
Diamond Collector (Wolfpack / Elite 7's) features **diamond collection** that triggers a free spins bonus:

**Mechanic:**
- Collect diamonds in spaces above reels
- <strong>15</strong> diamonds collected → Triggers free spins bonus
- Each diamond reveals a modifier during bonus
- Max <strong>5</strong> diamonds can land per spin

**Bonus Trigger Methods:**
1. Collect <strong>15</strong> diamonds
2. Land <strong>2</strong> scatter symbols on reels 2 and 4

---

PLAY WHEN:
<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- Diamonds collected: ≥ <strong>12</strong>

**How to Check:**
- Look **directly on bet pad**
- Shows diamond count for each bet level

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Check all denominations—different bet levels have different counts.

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Diamonds below <strong>12</strong>
- Unknown RTP setting and fewer than 12 diamonds
- Bonus just triggered (diamonds reset to 0)

---

STOP WHEN:
- Free spins bonus triggers
- Diamonds reset to <strong>0</strong>

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing at 10-11 diamonds without knowing RTP (too risky)
- Not checking the bet pad for diamond count
- Not checking all denominations
- Not understanding diamond collection slows down as spaces fill

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/diamond-collector-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/diamond-collector-3.jpg - This is an excellent play with only one diamond needed to trigger the bonus.
  Image 3: /images/games/diamond-collector-4.jpg - Once the free spins bonus is triggered, all of the collected diamonds reveal modifiers that enhance the bonus.


==================================================
GUIDE 23: DIAMOND TIDE JUNGLE
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
2+ yellow wilds in same row (adjacent or 1 gap apart) | 6+ yellow wilds total | Exclude reel 1 wilds and blue wilds (both leave next spin) | Check right of reel 5 for upcoming wilds marked

STOP PLAYING:
After all yellow wilds shift off screen (left side)

HOW IT WORKS:
Diamond Tide Jungle features **persistent yellow wilds that shift left**:

**Mechanic:**
- Yellow wilds shift one position LEFT every spin
- When wild reaches reel 1 → Shifts off screen next spin
- Upcoming wilds appear right of reel 5 (marked "W")

**Wild Types:**
| Wild Type | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| Yellow | Persistent, shifts left each spin |
| Blue | NOT persistent, disappears next spin |

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — Row Setup:**
- <strong>2+</strong> yellow wilds in SAME row
- Adjacent OR with <strong>1</strong> gap between them

**Option B — High Wild Count:**
- <strong>6+</strong> yellow wilds total (any position)

**Counting Rules:**
| Wild Location | Count It? |
|---------------|-----------|
| Reels 2-5 | ✅ Yes |
| Reel 1 | ❌ No (leaves next spin) |
| Blue wilds | ❌ No (disappear next spin) |
| Right of reel 5 ("W") | ✅ Yes (upcoming) |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Fewer than <strong>2</strong> yellow wilds in same row (not aligned)
- Fewer than <strong>6</strong> total yellow wilds
- Only blue wilds present
- Only reel 1 wilds remain

---

STOP WHEN:
- All yellow wilds shift off screen (left side)

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Counting reel 1 wilds (they leave next spin)
- Counting blue wilds (they disappear next spin)
- Not checking right of reel 5 for upcoming wilds
- Expecting 3-of-a-kind to pay well (need 4+ for decent payout)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/diamond-tide-jungle-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/diamond-tide-jungle-2.jpg - The blue diamond above the reels will occasionally shoot down an array of blue wilds.
  Image 3: /images/games/diamond-tide-jungle-3.jpg - I would avoid playing situations like this—the wild in the first reel will move off screen next spin and the other two wilds aren’t in a good position to help form a potential line hit.
  Image 4: /images/games/diamond-tide-jungle-4.jpg - This is an excellent play that will lead to guaranteed line hits on the next spin.

GUIDE 24: DIAMONDS & DEVILS / JADE MONKEY
==================================================

Category: accumulation
Volatility: medium
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
8+ free games with 2 diamonds | 16+ free games with 1 diamond | 24+ free games (any diamond count) | 10x+ credit value with 2 diamonds (yellow numbers = built up, silver = reset)

STOP PLAYING:
After collecting prize | When devil/jade monkey resets the reel (no longer +EV)

HOW IT WORKS:
Diamonds & Devils / Jade Monkey features **diamond collection with devil/monkey risk**:

**Mechanic:**
- Collect <strong>3</strong> diamonds above a reel → Win prize (credits or free games)
- Free games symbol lands → +<strong>8</strong> free games to that reel (max 80)
- Credit values build up as symbols land

**The Twist (Risk):**
- Devil/Jade Monkey lands → Removes <strong>1</strong> diamond
- No diamonds + Devil/Monkey → **RESETS entire reel** (loses all credits/free games)

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Free Games Thresholds:**
| Diamonds | Free Games Required | Action |
|----------|---------------------|--------|
| 2 | <strong>8+</strong> | ✅ **Play** |
| 1 | <strong>16+</strong> | ✅ **Play** |
| 0 | <strong>24+</strong> | ✅ **Play** (always) |

**Credit Value Thresholds:**
| Diamonds | Credit Value Required | Action |
|----------|----------------------|--------|
| 2 | <strong>10x+</strong> bet | ✅ **Play** |

**How to Identify Built-Up vs Reset:**
| Number Color | Meaning |
|--------------|---------|
| Yellow | Built up (has value) |
| Silver | At reset value (minimal) |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Free games don't meet threshold for diamond count
- Credit values below <strong>10x</strong> bet with 2 diamonds
- Reel just reset (silver numbers)
- No diamonds and below <strong>24</strong> free games

---

STOP WHEN:
- Prize collected (3 diamonds triggered)
- Devil/Monkey resets the reel
- No longer +EV

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Not knowing devil/monkey removes diamonds
- Chasing after reel reset (too late)
- Not cashing out immediately when play turns -EV
- Confusing yellow (built) vs silver (reset) numbers
- Playing credit values without enough diamonds

---

  Image 2: /images/games/diamonds--devils--jade-monkey-2.jpg
  Image 3: /images/games/diamonds--devils--jade-monkey-3.jpg - You can tell the credit prize above reel four is at reset due to its silver color.
  Image 4: /images/games/diamonds--devils--jade-monkey-4.jpg - This is an excellent play—I ended up triggering both of the free games prizes.
  Image 5: /images/games/diamonds--devils--jade-monkey-5.jpg - It’s rare to find credit values that run this high—this one is 40x the bet.
  Image 6: /images/games/diamonds--devils--jade-monkey-6.jpg - Even without any diamonds collected, 32 free games is always a play.

GUIDE 25: DICE SEEKER
==================================================

Category: cycle-based
Volatility: medium
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Large character (2x3 size) with 3 or fewer HP remaining | Two large characters with 5 or fewer HP each

STOP PLAYING:
After large character is defeated and prize pick completes

HOW IT WORKS:
Dice Seeker (Flappers & Dappers / Heroes & Villains / Viking Invasion) features **rectangles with hit points** above the reels:

**Mechanic:**
- Rectangles contain characters, credit values, treasure chests
- Each rectangle has HP counter (bottom right)
- Dice lands on reel → Number shoots up to remove HP from rectangle above
- HP reaches 0 → Win the prize

**Character Sizes:**
| Size | Dimensions | Value | Starting HP |
|------|------------|-------|-------------|
| Small | 1x1 | Low | Varies |
| Large | 2x3 | **High** | 16 |

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — Single Large Character:**
- Large (2x3) character with ≤ <strong>3</strong> HP remaining

**Option B — Two Large Characters:**
- Two large (2x3) characters each with ≤ <strong>5</strong> HP remaining

| Large Character HP | Single | Two Characters |
|--------------------|--------|----------------|
| ≤ 3 HP | ✅ **Play** | ✅ **Play** |
| 4–5 HP | ❌ Skip | ✅ **Play** (if both) |
| 6+ HP | ❌ Skip | ❌ Skip |

**How to Check (Free):**
- Tap menu icon (lower left)
- Use up/down arrows to cycle bet levels
- No ticket required

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Large characters above <strong>5</strong> HP (single) or <strong>6+</strong> HP (both)
- Only small (1x1) rectangles have good values
- Chasing credit values in small 1x1 blocks (too hard to hit specific reel)

---

STOP WHEN:
- Large character defeated
- Prize pick completed
- Character HP increases or resets

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Chasing 1x1 rectangles (hard to land dice on single reel)
- Playing large characters at 6+ HP
- Picking smallest prize (need volume to even out picks)
- Not checking all denominations

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/dice-seeker-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/dice-seeker-2.jpg
  Image 3: /images/games/dice-seeker-3.jpg
  Image 4: /images/games/dice-seeker-4.jpg - This is an excellent play with two of the large characters getting close to hitting (the large ones begin with 16 hit points).
  Image 5: /images/games/dice-seeker-5.jpg - You can cycle through the bet levels (without putting money in) by using the arrows in the menu.

GUIDE 26: DRAGON LIGHTS
==================================================

Category: must-hit-by
Volatility: low
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Mini (purple) at 25+ or Minor (blue) at 37+ or Major (yellow) at 56+ or Mega (red) at 86+ | Check bet pad to see meters at all bet levels

STOP PLAYING:
After free games progressive triggers

HOW IT WORKS:
Dragon Lights (Fortune Skies / Mystical Falls / Secret Fortress) features **four progressive free games meters**:

**Mechanic:**
- Progressive symbols land in reel 5 → Free games meter increases
- ⚠️ **NOT must-hit-by** — Triggers randomly
- All meters capped at <strong>200</strong> games (but won't auto-trigger at cap)

**Meter Multipliers:**
| Progressive | Color | Max Multiplier |
|-------------|-------|----------------|
| Mini | 🟣 Purple | 3x |
| Minor | 🔵 Blue | 5x |
| Major | 🟡 Yellow | 8x |
| Mega | 🔴 Red | 15x |

---

PLAY WHEN:
| Progressive | Color | Free Games | Action |
|-------------|-------|------------|--------|
| Mini | 🟣 Purple | ≥ <strong>25</strong> | ✅ Play |
| Minor | 🔵 Blue | ≥ <strong>37</strong> | ✅ Play |
| Major | 🟡 Yellow | ≥ <strong>56</strong> | ✅ Play (volatile) |
| Mega | 🔴 Red | ≥ <strong>86</strong> | ⚠️ Never chase directly |

**How to Check:**
- Look **directly on bet pad**
- Shows meters for all bet levels

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Progressive below threshold numbers
- You have limited bankroll (new APs should avoid)
- You cannot handle potential $1,000+ loss
- Directly chasing the mega (too volatile)
- Flames are showing but numbers below thresholds

---

STOP WHEN:
- Free games progressive triggers
- Loss limit reached (set BEFORE playing)
- ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Walking away at loss limit is correct—chasing deeper is how APs get destroyed

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing when flames appear (flames ≠ +EV, just average hit point)
- Directly chasing the mega (never do this)
- Not setting loss limits before playing
- Thinking more money in = closer to hitting (false)
- Playing with insufficient bankroll
- Continuing past loss limit because "it's an even better play now"

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/dragon-lights-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/dragon-lights-2.jpg - **You can look directly on the bet pad to see the meters on all bet levels.
  Image 3: /images/games/dragon-lights-3.jpg - The average hit point of the mini is 8 free games, so it’s rare (but not unheard of) to run this high.
  Image 4: /images/games/dragon-lights-4.jpg - The major at 64 free games is a solid (but still super volatile) play.
  Image 5: /images/games/dragon-lights-5.jpg - Hitting the mega while chasing the mini.
  Image 6: /images/games/dragon-lights-6.jpg - Even with only 22 free games, the mega paid out nicely for a $2.50 bet.


==================================================
GUIDE 27: Dragon Unleashed
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: low
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
2+ orbs in top row (reels 1-4 only) | 1 orb in top row + 2+ orbs in middle row | Aggressive: any orb in top row (unless 4-stack with bottom orb just left screen)

STOP PLAYING:
After hold & spin triggers (6 orbs) or all orbs shift off bottom of reels

HOW IT WORKS:
Dragon Unleashed features **persistent orbs** that shift down each spin:

**Mechanic:**
- Orbs with credit prizes land on reels 1–4
- Each spin → Orbs shift **down one row**
- Land <strong>6</strong> orbs → Triggers hold & spin feature
- Orbs often land as connected stacks (up to 4 tall)

**Orb Values:**
- Credit prizes: 1x to 100x bet
- Mini, Minor, Major jackpots

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — Basic (Recommended):**
- <strong>2+</strong> orbs in top row (reels 1–4)

**Option B — Mixed Position:**
- <strong>1</strong> orb in top row **AND**
- <strong>2+</strong> orbs in middle row

**Option C — Aggressive (Higher RTP):**
- Any orb in top row
- ❌ **EXCEPT:** 4-stack where bottom orb just exited (no more orbs coming from above)

**Orb Position Check:**
| Row | Orb Count | Action |
|-----|-----------|--------|
| Top | 2+ | ✅ **Play** |
| Top + Middle | 1 + 2+ | ✅ **Play** |
| Middle only | Any | ❌ Walk away |
| Bottom only | Any | ❌ Walk away |

⚠️ **NOTE:** Orbs only appear on reels <strong>1–4</strong> (not reel 5).

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- No orbs in top row
- Only orbs in middle/bottom rows
- 4-stack with bottom orb just shifted off screen
- Just triggered feature (orbs reset)

---

STOP WHEN:
- Hold & spin triggers (<strong>6</strong> orbs landed)
- All orbs shift off bottom of reels

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Counting orbs in reel 5 (orbs only appear reels 1–4)
- Playing when orbs only in middle/bottom rows
- Not recognizing 4-stack exhaustion pattern
- Not checking all denominations

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/dragon-unleashed-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/dragon-unleashed-2.jpg
  Image 3: /images/games/dragon-unleashed-3.jpg - Orbs with large credit prizes, like the one in reel four, are less likely to come in large stacks.
  Image 4: /images/games/dragon-unleashed-4.jpg - If a respin symbol lands in reel five, the reels with the orbs will lock in place and the other reels will spin again, giving you an additional chance to land the six orbs needed for the feature.
  Image 5: /images/games/dragon-unleashed-5.jpg - During the hold & spin feature, filling all 12 positions will award a spin of the Dragon Unleashed reel, which can lead to big wins like this.
  Image 6: /images/games/dragon-unleashed-6.jpg - Dragon Unleashed comes in a variety of themes, but they all play the same for advantage purposes.


==================================================
GUIDE 28: DRAGON SPHERE
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Wild spheres in reels 2-3 (not bottom row) | Reel 1 spheres in top 2 rows or above reel | Reel 4 spheres in top row or above reel | Check above reels for incoming spheres (switch bet levels to distinguish real spheres from expanded wilds)

STOP PLAYING:
After all wild spheres move off bottom of screen

HOW IT WORKS:
DragonSphere features **wild spheres that move DOWN**:

**Mechanic:**
- Wild spheres move DOWN one row every spin
- Wild lands on dragon symbol → ALL surrounding symbols turn wild
- Expansion: 3 spaces above, 3 below, 1 on each side (if room)

**Important:**
- Spheres move DOWN (opposite of Ocean Magic)
- Bottom row = Gone next spin

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — Reels 2-3 (Most Valuable):**
- Wild spheres in reels 2 or 3
- NOT on bottom row

**Option B — Reel 1:**
- Wild sphere above reel 1, OR
- Wild sphere in top row, OR
- Wild sphere in second-from-top row

**Option C — Reel 4:**
- Wild sphere above reel 4, OR
- Wild sphere in top row only

| Reel | Valid Positions | Action |
|------|-----------------|--------|
| Reel 1 | Above reel, top 2 rows | ✅ **Play** |
| Reel 2 | Anywhere except bottom | ✅ **Play** |
| Reel 3 | Anywhere except bottom | ✅ **Play** |
| Reel 4 | Above reel, top row only | ✅ **Play** |
| Any reel | Bottom row | ❌ Skip |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Wild spheres only on bottom row
- No wild spheres visible (including above reels)

---

STOP WHEN:
- All wild spheres move off bottom of screen

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing bottom row spheres (gone next spin)
- Not checking ABOVE reels for incoming spheres
- Confusing with Ocean Magic (spheres move DOWN here, not up)
- Confusing expanded wilds with real spheres

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/dragonsphere-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/dragonsphere-2.jpg - The wild sphere above reel four will move down into play next spin. Hustlers often overlook these, so it’s a good opportunity to find plays.
  Image 3: /images/games/dragonsphere-3.jpg - This was an amazing walk-up play I found. Ploppies will often cash out after a big win, so it’s not unheard of to find plays this good.


==================================================
GUIDE 29: Egyptian Gems: Rise of Pharaoh / Rise of Queen
==================================================

Category: cycle-based
Volatility: medium
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Yellow orb on reels 2-6 or in bottom queue position | 2+ yellow orbs anywhere in queue | 4+ red orbs | 6+ orbs any color (for free games bonus chance)

STOP PLAYING:
All orbs have moved off reel 1 | Free games bonus completes

HOW IT WORKS:
Egyptian Gems features **orbs with credit prizes** that move across the reels:

**Mechanic:**
- Orbs appear in queue (right side, above reels)
- Pyramid symbol lands → Bottom orb drops to reel 6 on same row
- Each spin → Orbs move **left one position**
- Orb lands on pyramid symbol → Win credit prize
- Orb triggered → Chance for Inner Reel Feature

**Orb Value Hierarchy:**
| Color | Prize Value |
|-------|-------------|
| 🟡 Yellow | Highest |
| 🔴 Red | Medium |
| 🔵 Blue | Lowest |

---

PLAY WHEN:
⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Do NOT count orbs in reel 1—they exit next spin.

**Option A — Yellow Orbs (On Reels):**
- Any yellow orb on reels <strong>2–6</strong>
- OR yellow orb in **bottom position** of queue

**Option B — Yellow Orbs (Queue):**
- <strong>2+</strong> yellow orbs anywhere in queue

**Option C — Red Orbs:**
- <strong>4+</strong> red orbs total

**Option D — Volume Play:**
- <strong>6+</strong> orbs of **any color**
- Value: Increased free games bonus chance (not credit prizes)

|--------------|--------|
| Yellow on reels 2–6 or bottom queue | ✅ **Play** |
| 2+ yellow anywhere in queue | ✅ **Play** |
| 4+ red orbs | ✅ **Play** |
| 6+ orbs any color | ✅ **Play** (bonus chance) |

**How to Check (Free):**
- Tap menu icon (lower left)
- Use up/down arrows to cycle bet levels
- No ticket required

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Only counting orbs in reel 1 (they exit next spin)
- Fewer than 4 red orbs (and no yellow)
- Fewer than 6 total orbs (and no yellow/red setup)
- Only blue orbs with low count

---

STOP WHEN:
- All orbs have moved off reel 1
- Free games bonus completes

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Counting orbs in reel 1 (they're gone next spin)
- Ignoring blue orbs for volume plays (6+ orbs gives bonus chance)
- Not checking queue for upcoming yellow orbs
- Missing that orbs can be triggered multiple times

---

  Image 3: /images/games/egyptian-gems-rise-of-pharaoh--rise-of-queen-3.jpg - This is an excellent play with a yellow orb in reel five, another yellow orb in the upcoming queue and six total orbs on the board.
  Image 4: /images/games/egyptian-gems-rise-of-pharaoh--rise-of-queen-4.jpg - The Inner Reel Feature triggered on the orb in reel one giving it a 3x multiplier.
  Image 5: /images/games/egyptian-gems-rise-of-pharaoh--rise-of-queen-5.jpg - The free games bonus was triggered by the Inner Reel Feature in the first reel. The orb in the sixth reel got doubled in value because two pyramid symbols landed in that row.
  Image 6: /images/games/egyptian-gems-rise-of-pharaoh--rise-of-queen-6.jpg - The free games bonus is fairly volatile, but it offers the potential for big wins.
  Image 7: /images/games/egyptian-gems-rise-of-pharaoh--rise-of-queen-7.jpg - Egyptian Gems comes in two themes—Rise of Pharaoh and Rise of Queen. Both versions play the same for advantage purposes.

GUIDE 30: EGYPTIAN STARS
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
2+ blue star frames anywhere except top row (top row frames leave next spin)

STOP PLAYING:
All star frames have moved off the top row (watch for frame bursts from woman

HOW IT WORKS:
Egyptian Stars features **blue star frames that move UP**:

**Mechanic:**
- Blue star-shaped frames move UP one position every spin
- Frame lands on credit value → Player wins that prize
- Frame lands on jackpot symbol → Wins jackpot

**Frame Awards:**
| Lands On | Award |
|----------|-------|
| Credit value | That credit amount |
| Mini/Minor/Maxi | Jackpot prize |
| Jackpot Chance | Wheel spin (Major/Grand possible) |

---

PLAY WHEN:
<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- <strong>2+</strong> blue star frames anywhere on reels
- NOT in top row (those leave next spin)

| Frame Position | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| Top row | ❌ Skip (leaves next spin) |
| Rows 2-4 (any reel) | ✅ **Play** |

**Note:** Reel position (1-5) doesn't matter here—frames award prizes, not wilds.

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Fewer than <strong>2</strong> blue star frames
- All frames in top row only

---

STOP WHEN:
- All star frames move off the top row
- Watch for frame bursts from woman's hand star

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Only counting visible frames (check for bursts)
- Avoiding reels 4-5 like Ocean Magic (not needed here—all reels work)
- Playing single frames (need 2+)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/egyptian-stars-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/egyptian-stars-2.jpg - The blue star-shaped frames move up one position every spin. The frame in the upper left will move off screen next spin, so only play if there are frames below the top row.
  Image 3: /images/games/egyptian-stars-3.jpg - Landing a blue star-shaped frame on top of a jackpot symbol will award that prize. The $10 mini is a solid win on a $0.75 bet.

GUIDE 31: Elephant King
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Free games, blue credit prizes, or green prizes 50x+ bet in reel 2 or 4 (play 1 spin) | Same prizes in both reels 3 and 5 (play 2 spins) | Ignore reel 1 (shifts off next spin)

STOP PLAYING:
After target prize shifts past reel 1

HOW IT WORKS:
Elephant King features a **Prize Disk** above the reels:

**Mechanic:**
- Prize Disk contains credit prizes and free games
- Each spin → Disk shifts **one position left**
- Elephant symbol lands on reel 1, 3, or 5 → Win prize above that reel

**Prize Disk Flow:**
```
Reel 5 → Reel 4 → Reel 3 → Reel 2 → Reel 1 → OFF SCREEN
```

---

PLAY WHEN:
**One Spin Play (Prize in Reel 2 or 4):**

- Blue credit prize in reel <strong>2</strong> or <strong>4</strong>
- Green credit prize ≥ <strong>50x</strong> bet in reel <strong>2</strong> or <strong>4</strong>

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing prizes above reel 1 (they're gone next spin)
- Playing small green credit prizes (need ≥50x bet)
- Playing yellow credit prizes (never worth it)
- Not recognizing Prize Disk shift direction

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/elephant-king-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/elephant-king-2.jpg
  Image 3: /images/games/elephant-king-3.jpg - Most of the green credit prizes are not worth playing. However, you will occasionally find exceptionally large ones like the one in reel five that is over 50x the bet.
  Image 4: /images/games/elephant-king-4.jpg - This is an excellent play with three free games prizes in the Prize Disk.

GUIDE 32: EPIC LION / SACRED DEER
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
10,000+ ways with gold-filled chevrons on full-height reels (thick flashing line on indicator) | Any of first 3 reels at full height (8 symbols) with gold-filled chevron above | First 3 reels all at 7 symbols tall

STOP PLAYING:
After reels shrink and ways drop below 10,000

HOW IT WORKS:
Epic Lion / Sacred Deer features **expanding reel heights**:

**Mechanic:**
- Reels grow taller → More ways to win
- Full height = <strong>8</strong> symbols tall
- Full height reel → Stays 1 extra spin → Then resets to <strong>4</strong> symbols

**Reel Height Range:**
| Height | Symbols |
|--------|---------|
| Minimum | 4 |
| Maximum | 8 (full) |

**Critical Caveat:**
- Full-height reel resets UNLESS chevron above is GOLD-filled
- Empty chevron = Treat as 4 symbols (it will shrink)
- Ways display can be MISLEADING (doesn't account for reset)

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — High Ways Count:**
- <strong>10,000+</strong> ways displayed
- **AND** chevrons filled on full-height reels

**Option B — Full Height Reel (1-3):**
- Any of first 3 reels at full height (<strong>8</strong> symbols)
- **AND** chevron above is GOLD-filled

**Option C — Tall Reels Setup:**
- First 3 reels ALL at <strong>7</strong> symbols tall

**How to Verify:**
| Indicator | Location |
|-----------|----------|
| Ways count | Below middle reel |
| Thick flashing line | 10,000+ ways |
| Gold-filled chevron | Above pyramid, above reel |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Ways below <strong>10,000</strong> (with empty chevrons)
- Full-height reels with EMPTY chevrons (will reset)
- First 3 reels below <strong>7</strong> symbols each

---

STOP WHEN:
- Reels shrink and ways drop below <strong>10,000</strong>

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Trusting ways display when chevrons are empty
- Not checking chevron fill state above full-height reels
- Expecting Hexbreak3r-level advantage (it's marginal)
- Playing too long after +EV window closes

---

Active wild on reel 2 or 3 (glowing border + coins above showing spins left) | Reel 4 wild with 2 spins remaining + 1 coin in reel 2 or 3 | Aggressive: 1 coin above both reels 2 and 3 (ignore built-up lanterns/stars - they

STOP PLAYING:
After wild spins deplete (coins above reels empty)

HOW IT WORKS:
Extreme Wild: Lanterns / Stars features **coin collection for wild reels**:

**Mechanic:**
- Coin holders above reels 2, 3, and 4

- Active wild = Glowing border around reel

**Visual Indicators:**
| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Basic Plays:**

**Option A — Active Wilds (Reels 2-3):**
- Active wild on reel 2 or 3
- Glowing border + coins above showing spins left

**Option B — Reel 4 Setup:**
- Active wild on reel 4 with <strong>2</strong> spins remaining
- AND <strong>1</strong> coin in reel 2 or 3
- Play 1 spin to see if second coin lands (if not, stop)

**Aggressive Play:**

**Option C — Coin Setup (Slightly +EV):**
- <strong>1</strong> coin above BOTH reels 2 AND 3
- Conservative: <strong>1</strong> coin above all 3 reels

| Setup | Risk Level | Action |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Active wild reel 2 or 3 | Low | ✅ **Play** |
| Reel 4 wild (2 spins) + coin in 2/3 | Medium | ✅ **1 spin** |
| 1 coin above reels 2 AND 3 | Higher | ✅ **Play** (aggressive) |

- RTP below 90% (aggressive play may not be +EV)

---

STOP WHEN:
- Wild spins deplete (coins above reels empty)
- Reel 4 test spin fails to land second coin

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing because lanterns/stars are built up (FAKE indicators)
- Playing reel 4 wilds without coin setup elsewhere
- Playing on sub-90% RTP machines (aggressive plays may be -EV)

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/extreme-wild-lanterns--stars-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/extreme-wild-lanterns--stars-2.jpg - The built-up lanterns/stars above the reels are fake indicators that don’t offer any advantage.
  Image 3: /images/games/extreme-wild-lanterns--stars-3.jpg
  Image 4: /images/games/extreme-wild-lanterns--stars-4.jpg - Expect to get a lot of dead spins interspersed with the occasional big line hit like this.
  Image 5: /images/games/extreme-wild-lanterns--stars-5.jpg - The free games bonus is volatile but can pay very well.

GUIDE 34: Fairy Hollow
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
2+ wild butterflies anywhere with counters showing 2 or 3 (check lower right of symbol) | Ignore wilds with counter of 1 (they disappear next spin)

STOP PLAYING:
All wild butterfly counters reach 0 and disappear

HOW IT WORKS:
Fairy Hollow features **wild butterflies** that persist for 3 spins:

**Mechanic:**
- Wild butterflies stick for <strong>3</strong> spins
- Counter in lower right shows spins remaining (3, 2, or 1)
- Counter of 1 = Disappears next spin (don't count)

**End2End Bookending Wilds:**
- Any 2 wilds on same row OR same reel connect
- All symbols between them turn WILD
- Example: Wild in reel 1 top + wild in reel 5 top = Full row of wilds

---

PLAY WHEN:
<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- <strong>2+</strong> active wilds anywhere
- Counter showing <strong>2</strong> or <strong>3</strong> (NOT 1)

| Wild Counter | Include? |
|--------------|----------|
| 3 | ✅ Count it |
| 2 | ✅ Count it |
| 1 | ❌ Don't count (disappears next spin) |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Fewer than <strong>2</strong> active wilds
- All wilds have counter of 1 (disappear next spin)

---

STOP WHEN:
- All wild butterfly counters reach 0
- All wilds disappear

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Counting wilds with counter of 1 (they disappear)
- Only looking at first 3 reels (End2End makes all positions valuable)
- Expecting 3-of-a-kind to pay well (need 4+ of a kind)

GUIDE 35: FAT FORTUNES
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
2 fish above the reels | 3+ persistent fish on reels (shiny/gleaming animation indicates persistence - ignore bottom row and non-shiny fish)

STOP PLAYING:
After bonus triggers (6 fish landed)

HOW IT WORKS:
Fat Fortunes (Fat Cat / Puffy Penguin / Jelly Jams) features **persistent fish with shiny indicator**:

**Mechanic:**
- <strong>6</strong> fish symbols → Triggers bonus
- Fish on reels → Disappear next spin
- Fish above reels → PERSISTENT, move down one position per spin

**The Secret (How to Identify Persistent Fish):**
- Wait a few seconds
- Persistent fish display **shining/gleaming animation**
- Non-shiny fish = NOT persistent (disappear next spin)

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — Fish Above Reels:**
- <strong>2</strong> fish symbols above the reels
- (Always excellent play—fish often come in stacks)

**Option B — Persistent Fish Count:**
- <strong>3+</strong> persistent fish on reels (shiny animation)
- Do NOT count: bottom row fish OR non-shiny fish

| Setup | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 2 fish above reels | ✅ **Play** (excellent) |
| 3+ shiny fish (not bottom row) | ✅ **Play** |
| Only non-shiny fish | ❌ Skip |
| Only bottom row fish | ❌ Skip |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Fewer than <strong>2</strong> fish above reels
- Fewer than <strong>3</strong> persistent (shiny) fish
- Fish only on bottom row
- Fish without shiny animation

---

STOP WHEN:
- Bonus triggers (6 fish landed)

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Not waiting for shiny animation to identify persistent fish
- Counting non-shiny fish as persistent
- Counting bottom row fish (they disappear)
- Revealing this knowledge to other hustlers

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/fat-fortunes-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/fat-fortunes-2.jpg - Landing six fish at once like this triggers the bonus.
  Image 3: /images/games/fat-fortunes-3.jpg - The orange fish with credit prizes count towards the six fish needed for the bonus. This one landed me an extra $100 going into the bonus.
  Image 4: /images/games/fat-fortunes-4.jpg - I hit the bonus on the previous spin for a $750 win. I have a good chance of hitting the bonus again on this next spin.
  Image 5: /images/games/fat-fortunes-5.jpg - This was a nice 78x win in the bonus feature.
  Image 6: /images/games/fat-fortunes-6.jpg - The bonus feature can be fairly volatile—this win was only 21x.
  Image 7: /images/games/fat-fortunes-7.jpg - Notice the glimmer on the fish in the fifth reel—that indicates it is persistent and will move down one position next spin.
  Image 8: /images/games/fat-fortunes-8.jpg
  Image 9: /images/games/fat-fortunes-9.jpg - This is an even better play—there will be four persistent fish in play on the next spin.
  Image 10: /images/games/fat-fortunes-10.jpg - This was a nice line hit, thanks to the wild penguin symbols that add a 2x multiplier to all wins.
  Image 11: /images/games/fat-fortunes-11.jpg - You can get pretty good bonus wins, even on small bets.

GUIDE 36: FORTUNE FINDERS
==================================================

Category: cycle-based
Volatility: medium
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
2+ scatter symbols anywhere EXCEPT bottom row (white pearls in Mermaid

STOP PLAYING:
After free games bonus triggers | All scatters fall off bottom row

HOW IT WORKS:
Fortune Finders (Mermaid's Pearl / Hidden Riches) features **persistent scatter symbols**:

**Mechanic:**
- <strong>3</strong> scatter symbols → Triggers free games bonus
- Scatter symbols are PERSISTENT
- Move DOWN one row every spin

|-------|----------------|
| Mermaid's Pearl | White pearls |
| Hidden Riches | Red crystals |

---

PLAY WHEN:
<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- <strong>2+</strong> scatter symbols anywhere on reels
- NOT on bottom row (those leave next spin)

| Scatter Position | Action |
|------------------|--------|
| Top/Middle rows | ✅ **Play** |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Fewer than <strong>2</strong> scatter symbols visible
- All scatters on bottom row only

---

STOP WHEN:
- Free games bonus triggers (3 scatters landed)
- All scatters fall off bottom row

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Counting bottom row scatters (they leave next spin)
- Not checking all bet levels/denominations

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/fortune-finders-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/fortune-finders-2.jpg - The free games bonus scatter symbols move down one row every spin.
  Image 3: /images/games/fortune-finders-3.jpg - Landing three scatter symbols will trigger the free games bonus.
  Image 4: /images/games/fortune-finders-4.jpg - In the Hidden Riches version, the scatter symbols are red crystals.

GUIDE 37: Fortune Owl
==================================================

Category: must-hit-by
Volatility: low
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Mini (purple) at 24+ free games | Minor (green) at 32+ | Major (red) at 52+ | NOT a must-hit-by - requires 1000+ unit bankroll

STOP PLAYING:
After free games bonus triggers

HOW IT WORKS:
Fortune Owl features **three progressive free games meters** (NOT must-hit-by):

**Mechanic:**
- Free games symbol lands in reel 4 → Corresponding meter increases
- Bonus triggered → Win accumulated free games
- Reset value: <strong>5</strong> free games (all meters)

**Free Games Wild Reels:**
| Meter | Color | Wild Reels Per Spin |
|-------|-------|---------------------|
| Mini | Purple | 1 full reel |
| Minor | Green | 2 full reels |
| Major | Red | 3 full reels |

---

PLAY WHEN:
| Meter | Color | Free Games Threshold |
|-------|-------|---------------------|
| Mini | Purple | ≥ <strong>24</strong> |
| Minor | Green | ≥ <strong>32</strong> |
| Major | Red | ≥ <strong>52</strong> |

**How to Check:**
- Look directly on bet pad
- Shows free games count for all bet levels

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Mini below <strong>24</strong> free games
- Minor below <strong>32</strong> free games
- Major below <strong>52</strong> free games
- Bankroll below <strong>1000</strong> units
- You are a newer AP with limited bankroll

---

STOP WHEN:
- Free games bonus triggers
- Meter resets to <strong>5</strong>
- You hit your loss limit (set one before playing)

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Thinking more spins = closer to hitting (NOT TRUE)
- Chasing without adequate bankroll
- Not setting a loss limit before playing
- Abandoning play seems wrong but is often correct for bankroll management

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/fortune-owl-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/fortune-owl-2.jpg - Landing two bonus scatter symbols along with one of the progressive free games symbols in reel four will trigger the corresponding bonus.
  Image 3: /images/games/fortune-owl-3.jpg - You can look directly on the bet pad to see the number of free games on all bet levels.

GUIDE 38: Fu Dai Lian Lian
==================================================

Category: accumulation
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
2+ bags glowing with jewels visible (check bet pad for jewels in bags) | Aggressive: 1 bag with jewels + 1 level 4 bag (largest size before jewels appear)

STOP PLAYING:
After triggering one boosted bag bonus (bag size does not affect trigger chance)

HOW IT WORKS:
Fu Dai Lian Lian: Boost Peacock / Boost Tiger features **three bags** that fill with coins:

**Mechanic:**
- Colored coins land → Corresponding bag fills
- Bags grow through 4 size levels
- Level 5 = **Jewels appear, bag glows**
- Jewels = Bonus is "boosted" with enhanced features
- ⚠️ **Bigger bags ≠ closer to triggering** (random chance on each coin)

**Bag Progression:**
| Level | Size | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| 1–3 | Small | ❌ Not playable |
| 4 | Largest (no jewels) | ⚠️ Aggressive only |
| 5 | Glowing with jewels | ✅ **Playable** |

---

PLAY WHEN:
<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- <strong>2+</strong> bags with jewels (glowing)

**Aggressive Play (Higher Variance):**
- <strong>1</strong> bag with jewels **AND**
- <strong>1</strong> Level 4 bag (largest size without jewels)

**How to Check:**
- Look **directly on bet pad**
- Bags with jewels visible on bet pad
- If you see bags on bet pad, you have correct version

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Fewer than <strong>2</strong> bags with jewels (unless aggressive setup)
- Playing Panda or Dragon versions (no advantage)
- Not seeing bags on bet pad (wrong version)
- You cannot handle high variance losses

---

STOP WHEN:
- Any bag bonus triggers
- Do NOT continue even if other bags still have jewels
- Re-evaluate after bonus completes

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing wrong Fu Dai Lian Lian version (must be Boost Peacock/Tiger)
- Thinking bigger bags = closer to triggering (false)
- Continuing after triggering one bag
- Playing with insufficient bankroll

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/fu-dai-lian-lian-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/fu-dai-lian-lian-2.jpg - The red bag in the middle is a “level 4” bag, which is the largest size the bags grow to before they get jewels.
  Image 3: /images/games/fu-dai-lian-lian-3.jpg - Having all three bags with jewels like this is an excellent play (but still very high variance).
  Image 4: /images/games/fu-dai-lian-lian-4.jpg - It’s fairly common to trigger multiple bags at the same time, which makes the bonus even more lucrative.
  Image 5: /images/games/fu-dai-lian-lian-5.jpg - The boosted bonus usually pays very well, even if you just trigger one bag. The above is still a play after the bonus ends because there are still two bags with jewels.
  Image 6: /images/games/fu-dai-lian-lian-6.jpg - You can check this machine by looking directly on the bet pad. You can see the jewels in the red bag on the right.

GUIDE 39: Fu Stacks: Jade / Crimson
==================================================

Category: accumulation
Volatility: medium
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
2 coins in each of the first 3 reels (in coin holders above reels) | Any active stacks in first 3 reels (glowing border around reel)

STOP PLAYING:
Active stack spins deplete | First 3 reels no longer have coins

HOW IT WORKS:
Fu Stacks (Jade / Crimson) features **coin collection for matching symbol stacks**:

**Mechanic:**
- Coins land → Slide open to reveal matching symbols
- Stack of <strong>3</strong> coins lands → Adds 1 coin to holder above
- Coin holder reaches <strong>3</strong> coins → Reel features coin stacks for <strong>3</strong> spins

**Key Difference from Similar Games:**
- Reels DON'T turn wild
- Stacks reveal matching symbols (all coins match each other)

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — Coin Setup:**
- <strong>2</strong> coins in EACH of the first 3 reels (coin holders above)

**Option B — Active Stacks:**
- Active stack in any of first 3 reels
- Active = Glowing border around reel

| Setup | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 2 coins in reels 1, 2, AND 3 | ✅ **Play** |
| Active stack in reels 1-3 | ✅ **Play** |
| Active stack only in reel 4 | ❌ Skip (little value) |
| Coins not in all first 3 reels | ❌ Skip |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- First 3 reels don't all have 2 coins
- Active stacks only in reels 4-5
- No glowing borders on first 3 reels

---

STOP WHEN:
- Active stack spins deplete
- First 3 reels no longer have adequate coins

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing active stacks in reel 4 alone (not enough value)
- Not understanding goal is reels 1-3 active together
- Thinking reels turn wild (they don't—just matching symbols)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/fu-stacks-jade--crimson1-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/fu-stacks-jade--crimson1-2.jpg
  Image 3: /images/games/fu-stacks-jade--crimson1-3.jpg
  Image 4: /images/games/fu-stacks-jade--crimson1-4.jpg - There isn’t much value in an active wild in the fourth reel, especially without adequate coins in the first three reels.
  Image 5: /images/games/fu-stacks-jade--crimson1-5.jpg - The Crimson version plays the same for advantage purposes.

GUIDE 40: GIFT OF THE NILE
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Single wild in reels 1-3 (top/middle row or directly above in queue) | 2 wilds in front 3 queue positions | 2 wilds same row in middle queue | 3+ wilds (stack) in back queue | Note: FREE GAMES symbols are NOT persistent

STOP PLAYING:
After all wilds move off the bottom row (check queue for new wilds)

HOW IT WORKS:
Gift of the Nile / Dragon Flame features **persistent wilds with visible queue**:

**Mechanic:**
- Wilds move DOWN one row every spin
- Queue visible ABOVE reels (see them coming)
- Wilds often appear in big stacks

**Important:**
- Only WILD symbols are persistent
- FREE GAMES symbols are NOT persistent (don't chase them)

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Focus on first 3 reels only.** The further back in queue, the more wilds needed:

**Active Reel Area (Top/Middle Rows):**
- <strong>1</strong> wild in reels 1-3 (top or middle row)
- <strong>1</strong> wild directly above reel (first queue position)

**Front Queue (First 3 Positions):**
- <strong>2</strong> wilds in first 3 queue positions (reels 1-3)

**Middle Queue:**
- <strong>2</strong> wilds on SAME row (reels 1-3)

**Back Queue:**
- <strong>3</strong> wilds on same row (reels 1-3)
- OR stack of <strong>3+</strong> wilds together (reels 1-3)

| Wild Location | Wilds Required | Action |
|---------------|----------------|--------|
| Active area (top/middle) | 1 | ✅ **Play** |
| Directly above reel | 1 | ✅ **Play** |
| Front 3 queue positions | 2 | ✅ **Play** |
| Middle queue (same row) | 2 | ✅ **Play** |
| Back queue (same row) | 3 | ✅ **Play** |
| Back queue (stack) | 3+ | ✅ **Play** |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Wilds only in reels 4-5
- Single wild far back in queue
- FREE GAMES symbols (not persistent!)
- Wilds not aligned or too few for queue position

---

STOP WHEN:
- All wilds move off bottom row
- Check queue for new wilds before leaving

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Chasing FREE GAMES symbols (NOT persistent)
- Playing wilds in reels 4-5 (little value)
- Not checking queue depth vs wild count
- Missing wilds that appear mid-queue

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/gift-of-the-nile-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/gift-of-the-nile-2.jpg - The stack of wilds in the upcoming queue above the first reel will enter into play within two spins.
  Image 3: /images/games/gift-of-the-nile-3.jpg - This is an excellent play. There are wilds in the active reel area within the first three reels, with more coming in the queue above.
  Image 4: /images/games/gift-of-the-nile-4.jpg - The free games bonus symbols are not persistent, so this is not a play.
  Image 5: /images/games/gift-of-the-nile-5.jpg - This is not a play. The two wilds in the upcoming queue are not on the same row and they are far enough back where it’s not worth the cost to bring them into play.
  Image 6: /images/games/gift-of-the-nile-6.jpg - **The Dragon Flame version plays the same for advantage purposes.

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
4 of 5 pots contain jackpot wheel or high free games (16/20/24) | Avoid if any pot shows 8 free games

STOP PLAYING:
After triggering any pot

HOW IT WORKS:
Golden Dragon / Golden Guardian features **5 pots** at the bottom of each reel:

**Trigger Mechanic:**
- Tall dragon symbol lands fully within a reel
- Player wins the prize in that reel's pot
- After ANY pot triggers → **All pots reset randomly**

**Possible Pot Prizes:**

| Prize | Color | Value |
|-------|-------|-------|
| 8 Free Games | ❌ Low | Avoid |
| 12 Free Games | 🟡 Medium | Marginal |
| 16 Free Games | 🟢 Green | Good |
| 20 Free Games | 🟢 Green | Good |
| 24 Free Games | 🔴 Red | Excellent |
| Jackpot Wheel | 🎡 Wheel | Excellent |

---

PLAY WHEN:
<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- <strong>4 of 5</strong> pots contain high-value prizes

<strong>High-Value Prizes:</strong>
- Jackpot Wheel spin
- 24 free games (red)
- 20 free games (green)
- 16 free games (green)

<strong>Pot Configuration Check:</strong>
- Pot 1 (Reel 1): High value? ✅/❌
- Pot 2 (Reel 2): High value? ✅/❌
- Pot 3 (Reel 3): High value? ✅/❌
- Pot 4 (Reel 4): High value? ✅/❌
- Pot 5 (Reel 5): High value? ✅/❌

**Need ≥4 checkmarks to play.**

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Each pot has only 20% chance of being triggered. Don't play for a single good pot.

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Any pot shows <strong>8 free games</strong> (too high risk of hitting it)
- Fewer than <strong>4</strong> high-value pots
- Only 1 excellent pot (24 free games or wheel) with poor others
- You cannot handle high variance

---

STOP WHEN:
- Any pot triggers (all pots reset afterward)
- Bankroll loss exceeds predetermined limit

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing for a single 24 free games pot (only 20% chance to hit it)
- Not checking ALL 5 pots before playing
- Playing with ANY 8 free games pot visible
- Underestimating the variance (can take many spins to trigger)
- Continuing after a pot triggers (all pots reset)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/golden-dragons-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/golden-dragons-2.jpg - This is a solid play with four of the five pots containing jackpot wheel spins.
  Image 3: /images/games/golden-dragons-3.jpg - Plays like this may be tempting, but you have a 40% chance of hitting one of the 8 free games pots, which is too risky. All of the pots will be reset with random prizes after one is triggered.
  Image 4: /images/games/golden-dragons-4.jpg - This is an excellent play (but still extremely volatile).
  Image 5: /images/games/golden-dragons-5.jpg - This is a worst possible scenario where all pots include the lowest prize available.
  Image 6: /images/games/golden-dragons-6.jpg - The red pot with 24 free games is very valuable, but you only have a one in five chance of hitting it.

GUIDE 42: GOLDEN EGYPT GRANDE
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
2 of first 3 reels 1 coin away from wild | 6+ coins in first 4 reels | Active wilds in first 3 reels (glowing gold border) | Active wilds in both reels 4 and 5

STOP PLAYING:
After all wild spins deplete (coins above reels empty)

HOW IT WORKS:
Golden Egypt Grand features **coin holders** above each reel:

**Mechanic:**
- Coins land above reels
- Coin holder fills → Reel turns WILD
- Wild lasts 2-4 spins (based on coins in holder)
- Active wild = Glowing gold border + coins above

**Notation:** 1-2-0-0-0 = Reel 1 has 1 coin, Reel 2 has 2 coins, Reels 3-5 have 0

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — Two Reels Ready (First Three):**
- <strong>2</strong> of first 3 reels are 1 coin away from wild
- Examples: 1-2-0-0-0 | 0-2-3-0-0 | 1-0-3-0-0

**Option B — Six Coins Total:**
- <strong>6+</strong> coins in first 4 reels
- Examples: 1-1-2-2-0 | 0-2-2-2-0 | 0-1-3-2-0

**Option C — Active Wilds in First Three:**
- Any active wild in reels 1-3
- (Glowing gold border + coins above)

**Option D — Reel 4 Active + Setup:**
- Reel 4 has active wild
- AND any of first 3 reels is 1 coin away
- Play 1-2 spins to try landing coin for double wild

**Option E — Reels 4 AND 5 Active:**
- Active wilds in **both** reels 4 and 5

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Only reel 4 or 5 active alone
- Fewer than 6 coins with no reels near trigger
- No active wilds and not enough coin setup

---

STOP WHEN:
- All wild spins deplete
- Coins above reels empty

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing single active wild in reel 4 or 5
- Not counting total coins in first 4 reels
- Not recognizing active wild indicator (gold border)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/golden-egypt-grand-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/golden-egypt-grand-2.jpg - This is a best case scenario, where each reel is one coin away from turning wild.
  Image 3: /images/games/golden-egypt-grand-3.jpg - Reel one will be wild for the next two spins, reel two will be wild for the next one spin, reel three will be wild for the next four spins and reel five will be wild for the next two spins.
  Image 4: /images/games/golden-egypt-grand-4.jpg - Most APs will only play when two of the first three reels are one coin away. However, I would still play in situations like this, where there are six coins in the first four reels.
  Image 5: /images/games/golden-egypt-grand-5.jpg - Getting all five reels wild at the same time will pay 300x the bet.


==================================================
GUIDE 43: Golden Gecko
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
3+ red jewels in active row (directly above reels) | 5+ red jewels in active + first queue row | 7+ red jewels in active + first 2 queue rows

STOP PLAYING:
After red progressive triggers | Red jewels drop past active row without hitting

HOW IT WORKS:
Golden Gecko features **colored jewels with progressive jackpots**:

**Mechanic:**
- Jewel above each reel + 4 more in queue above
- Wild lands on reel → Jewel drops, next in queue replaces it
- Full reel of wilds + colored jewel → Progressive jackpot

**Jewel Types:**
| Jewel Color | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Gold | 2x-5x multiplier (COMMON - no advantage) |
| Blue | Blue progressive (small) |
| Green | Green progressive |
| Purple | Purple progressive |
| **Red** | **Red progressive (largest - ONLY worth chasing)** |

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Red Jewels Only (by position):**

| Red Jewel Position | Count Required | Action |
|--------------------|----------------|--------|
| Active row (directly above reels) | <strong>3+</strong> | ✅ **Play** |
| Active + first queue row | <strong>5+</strong> | ✅ **Play** |
| Active + first 2 queue rows | <strong>7+</strong> | ✅ **Play** |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Fewer red jewels than threshold for position
- Only gold jewels (no advantage—extremely common)
- Only blue/green/purple jewels (not worth chasing)

---

STOP WHEN:
- Red progressive triggers
- Red jewels drop past active row without hitting

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Chasing gold jewels (extremely common, no advantage)
- Chasing smaller progressives (blue/green/purple)
- Not counting red jewels by queue position
- Playing without enough reds for queue depth

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/golden-gecko-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/golden-gecko-2.jpg - The gold jewels add multipliers to the wilds, but they are extremely common, and as such, are not worth chasing.
  Image 3: /images/games/golden-gecko-3.jpg - This is an excellent (although still high variance) play, with four active red jewels.

GUIDE 44: GOLDEN JUNGLE GRAND
==================================================

Category: cycle-based
Volatility: medium
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Spin counter showing 1-9 of 10 with favorable buddha distribution (2 full reels in first 3 positions is always playable) | Never play spin 10 of 10

STOP PLAYING:
After spin 10 completes (wild reels trigger based on collected buddhas)

HOW IT WORKS:
Golden Jungle Grand operates on a **10-game cycle** with buddha collection:

**Mechanic:**
- Buddha symbols collected above each reel (max 2 per reel)
- After spin 10 → Reels with 2 buddhas turn WILD
- Only 1 buddha can land per reel per spin
- Cycle resets after spin 10

**Goal:** Get 3+ of first 4 reels wild for good profit

---

PLAY WHEN:
N/A

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Game <strong>10</strong> of 10 (NEVER)
- Buddha distribution doesn't match patterns above
- No buddhas in first three reels with many spins remaining

---

STOP WHEN:
- Spin 10 completes
- Wild reels trigger based on collected buddhas
- Cycle resets

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing game 10 of 10 (always skip)
- Expecting win with only 1-2 wild reels
- Not recognizing playable buddha patterns
- Playing weak distributions early in cycle

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/golden-jungle-grand-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/golden-jungle-grand-2.jpg - This is a walk-up play I found that someone had abandoned on spin 9 of 10.
  Image 3: /images/games/golden-jungle-grand-3.jpg

3 reels with 2 coins each | 5 or more coins in the first 3 reels | 7 or more coins anywhere (ignore reels already at 3 coins - they reset next spin)

STOP PLAYING:
After prize pick completes

HOW IT WORKS:
Golden Messenger features **coin collection with prize pick**:

**Mechanic:**
- Collect <strong>3</strong> coins above a reel → Choose prize from 3 options
- Reel also turns wild for <strong>1</strong> spin (only 1 spin, not 3)

**Prize Types (by reel color):**
| Reel Color | Prize Type |
|------------|------------|
| Green | Credit prize pick |
| Blue | Free games pick |
| Red | Jackpot prize pick |

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Important:** Do NOT count reels already at 3 coins (coins removed next spin).

**Option A — Three Reels Setup:**
- <strong>3</strong> reels each with <strong>2</strong> coins

**Option B — First 3 Reels:**
- <strong>5+</strong> coins in first 3 reels

**Option C — Any Reels:**
- <strong>7+</strong> coins anywhere

| Coin Setup | Action |
|------------|--------|
| 3 reels with 2 coins each | ✅ **Play** |
| 5+ coins in reels 1-3 | ✅ **Play** |
| 7+ coins anywhere | ✅ **Play** |
| Reel already at 3 coins | ❌ Don't count (resets) |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Fewer than required coins for setup type
- Only counting reels already at 3 coins

---

STOP WHEN:
- Prize pick completes

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Counting reels with 3 coins (they reset next spin)
- Expecting every play to profit (volatile—need many sessions)
- Not prioritizing first 3 reels (wild reel more valuable there)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/golden-messenger-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/golden-messenger-2.jpg - The three coins in the first reel will be removed on the next spin, so this is not a play.
  Image 3: /images/games/golden-messenger-3.jpg - There is usually one good prize and two bad ones. You need to log enough sessions to even out the bad picks with the good picks.

GUIDE 46: HONEY BUCKS
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
2+ active wilds in first 3 reels (horizontally connected or 1 gap apart) | 3 horizontally connected active wilds anywhere | 4+ active wilds in first 3 reels (empty space = 2 spins left, yellow WILD = 1 spin left, cracked = ignore)

STOP PLAYING:
After all active wilds crack and disappear

HOW IT WORKS:
Honey Bucks features **persistent wilds** from bees leaving the honeycomb:

**Mechanic:**
- Up to 5 bees randomly fly from honeycomb → Leave empty space
- Empty space = WILD for next 2 spins
- Bees fly out every few spins

**Wild Appearance Stages:**
| Visual | Spins Remaining | Playable? |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| Empty space in honeycomb | 2 spins | ✅ Yes |
| Yellow "WILD" with honey dripping | 1 spin | ✅ Yes |
| Cracked wild | 0 (disappears next spin) | ❌ No |

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — Two Wilds in First Three Reels:**
- <strong>2</strong> active wilds in reels 1-3
- Must be horizontally connected OR one gap apart

**Option B — Three Connected Wilds:**
- <strong>3</strong> horizontally connected active wilds
- Can be anywhere on reels

**Option C — Four Wilds:**
- <strong>4+</strong> active wilds in first three reels

| Wilds | Position | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| 2 connected/1-gap | Reels 1-3 | ✅ **Play** |
| 3 connected | Anywhere | ✅ **Play** |
| 4+ | Reels 1-3 | ✅ **Play** |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Wilds are cracked (disappear next spin)
- Only 1 wild in first three reels
- Wilds not horizontally aligned
- 2+ gap between wilds in reels 1-3

---

STOP WHEN:
- All active wilds crack and disappear
- No playable wild combinations remain

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing cracked wilds (they disappear next spin)
- Not recognizing wild stages (empty vs yellow vs cracked)
- Playing wilds that aren't horizontally connected/aligned
- Ignoring this game (most APs don't know about it)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/honey-bucks-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/honey-bucks-2.jpg - Five bees flew off the reels, leaving behind five empty spaces in the honeycomb. These spaces will be wild for the next two spins.
  Image 3: /images/games/honey-bucks-3.jpg - This is what the empty spaces from the previous photo will look like after the next spin. Yellow wilds like these will be around for one more spin.
  Image 4: /images/games/honey-bucks-4.jpg - Don’t play wilds that look like these—they will disappear on the next spin.


==================================================
GUIDE 47: HYPER ORBS
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
12+ orbs collected (check bet pad for each denomination) | Scatter symbol with number inside on reel 2 or 4 (sticks for that many spins, need 2 to trigger bonus)

STOP PLAYING:
After free spins bonus triggers (orb count resets to zero)

HOW IT WORKS:
Hyper Orbs (King of the Seas / Dragon Sense) features **orb collection** that triggers free spins:

**Mechanic:**
- Orbs land on reels → Collected (can also drop from above reels)
- <strong>15</strong> orbs collected → Triggers free spins bonus
- Each orb expands a random reel by 1 space during bonus
- Max reel expansion: <strong>3</strong> spaces per reel

**Bonus Trigger Methods:**
1. Collect <strong>15</strong> orbs
2. Land <strong>2</strong> scatter symbols on reels 2 and 4

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — Orb Count:**
- Orbs collected: ≥ <strong>12</strong>

**Option B — Scatter Symbol:**
- Number symbol visible in reel 2 OR reel 4
- Number inside = spins it sticks around
- Also functions as wild
- Need 2 to trigger bonus

**How to Check:**
- Look **directly on bet pad**
- Shows orb count for each bet level

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Check all denominations—different bet levels have different counts.

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Orbs below <strong>12</strong>
- Unknown RTP setting and fewer than 12 orbs
- Bonus just triggered (orbs reset to 0)

---

STOP WHEN:
- Free spins bonus triggers
- Orb count resets to <strong>0</strong>

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing at 10-11 orbs without knowing RTP (too risky)
- Not checking the bet pad for orb count
- Not checking all denominations
- Not recognizing numbered scatter symbols as plays

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/hyper-orbs-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/hyper-orbs-3.jpg - 13 of the 15 orbs needed to trigger the bonus have been collected already. This is an excellent play.
  Image 3: /images/games/hyper-orbs-4.jpg - This free spins scatter symbol will stick around for three more spins. Landing two of these will trigger the bonus, so always play if there is a number inside the symbol. It also functions as a wild.

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Progressive below percentage threshold for tier
- Top progressive at lower bet levels (poor hourly rate)

---

STOP WHEN:
- Targeted MHB jackpot triggers and resets

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Chasing top progressive at low bets (hours for small profit)
- Not checking all 5 bet levels
- Playing non-deluxe version (no MHBs)
- Not tapping "Bet Per Line" to check without money

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/igt-classic-hits-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/igt-classic-hits-2.jpg - This was a nice $396 line hit while closing in on the bottom MHB.
  Image 3: /images/games/igt-classic-hits-3.jpg - The meter on the bottom MHB is at 96.15%—anything 95% or above is playable.
  Image 4: /images/games/igt-classic-hits-4.jpg - This was an awesome walk-up play with the bottom meter already at 97%.
  Image 5: /images/games/igt-classic-hits-5.jpg - This extremely lucky 660x line hit occurred while I was chasing the $40 MHB.

GUIDE 49: Imperial Fortunes / Penguin Palace
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
2 coins collected in first 3 reels with at least one 2x coin | 1 coin in each of first 4 reels | Active wilds in first 3 reels (gold highlight) | Reel 4 wild active with 2x coins above

STOP PLAYING:
After wild spins deplete (coin holders above wilds empty)

HOW IT WORKS:
Imperial Fortunes / Penguin Palace features **coin collection for wild reels with 2x multipliers**:

**Game Variants:**
- Imperial Fortunes
- Penguin Palace

**Mechanic:**
- Coin holders above each reel
- <strong>2</strong> coins collected → Reel turns wild for <strong>2</strong> spins
- Active wilds highlighted in gold
- Coins in holder show spins remaining

**Key Difference from Red Silk/Aztec Chief:**
- <strong>2x</strong> multiplier coins can land (reels 2-4)
- More lucrative AP game
- Play slightly looser than Red Silk

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — Coins with 2x:**
- <strong>2</strong> coins collected in first 3 reels
- At least one must be a <strong>2x</strong> coin

**Option B — Four Coins Setup:**
- <strong>1</strong> coin in each of first 4 reels
- More aggressive play (usually need 2x to profit)

**Option C — Active Wilds (Reels 1-3):**
- Active wilds (gold highlight) in first 3 reels
- 1 or 2 coins showing spins remaining

**Option D — Active Wild (Reel 4):**
- Active wild in reel 4 with <strong>2x</strong> coins above

**Option E — Reel 4 Test Spin:**
- Reel 4 wild with <strong>2</strong> spins remaining
- AND <strong>2+</strong> coins in first 3 reels
- Play <strong>1</strong> spin for double wild chance
- Stop if no second coin lands

| Setup | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 2 coins (reels 1-3) with 2x | ✅ **Play** |
| 1 coin in each of reels 1-4 | ✅ **Play** (aggressive) |
| Active wilds in reels 1-3 | ✅ **Play** |
| Reel 4 wild with 2x coins | ✅ **Play** |
| Reel 4 wild (2 spins) + 2 coins | ✅ **1 spin test** |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Only coins without 2x multipliers (less profitable)
- Active wilds only in reels 4-5 without 2x
- Test spin fails to land second coin

---

STOP WHEN:
- Wild spins deplete (coin holders empty)
- Test spin fails to land second coin

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing like Red Silk (this game has 2x multipliers)
- Ignoring 2x coin opportunities
- Thinking pot display matters (entertainment only)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/imperial-fortunes--penguin-palace-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/imperial-fortunes--penguin-palace-2.jpg - This is a solid play with a 2x coin collected about the third reel and another coin collected above the second reel.
  Image 3: /images/games/imperial-fortunes--penguin-palace-3.jpg - I would play a setup like this for one spin because of the active 2x coin above reel four.
  Image 4: /images/games/imperial-fortunes--penguin-palace-4.jpg - I would avoid setups like this in Red Silk/Aztec Chief, but this is a slightly +EV play due to the possibility of landing a 2x coin in one or more of the first three reels.
  Image 5: /images/games/imperial-fortunes--penguin-palace-5.jpg - This paid out nearly 100x due to the 2x coin in reel two. The middle reel will be wild for one more spin.
  Image 6: /images/games/imperial-fortunes--penguin-palace-6.jpg - You can get huge wins with the 2x multipliers.
  Image 7: /images/games/imperial-fortunes--penguin-palace-7.jpg - Imperial Fortunes is a clone of Penguin Palace.

GUIDE 50: INDIAN MOTORCYCLE
==================================================

Category: cycle-based
Volatility: medium
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
PLAY MIN BET ONLY: 7 trophies | 6 trophies + 2000+ bonus credits | 5 trophies + 3000+ bonus credits | 4 trophies + 4000+ bonus credits | 3 trophies + 5000+ bonus credits (bonus amount shown above reels)

STOP PLAYING:
After wheel spin bonus completes (resets to 2 trophies)

HOW IT WORKS:
Indian Motorcycle features a **trophy collection system**:

**Mechanic:**
- Collect <strong>8</strong> gold trophies → Triggers wheel spin bonus
- Trophies only land in reel 5
- Each trophy adds 1x-5x bet to bonus award pool
- After bonus: Resets to <strong>2</strong> trophies

**Critical Strategy:**
- Trophy count is SHARED across all bet levels
- Bonus award accumulates in credits (not multipliers)
- **Always play minimum bet** to maximize value from others' higher bets

---

PLAY WHEN:
| Trophies | Bonus Credits Required | Action |
|----------|------------------------|--------|
| <strong>7</strong> | Any amount | ✅ **Play** |
| <strong>6</strong> | <strong>2000+</strong> credits | ✅ **Play** |
| <strong>5</strong> | <strong>3000+</strong> credits | ✅ **Play** |
| <strong>4</strong> | <strong>4000+</strong> credits | ✅ **Play** |
| <strong>3</strong> | <strong>5000+</strong> credits | ✅ **Play** |
| Below 3 | Any | ❌ Walk away |

**Where to Check:**
- Trophies: Count gold trophies displayed
- Bonus credits: Middle of screen above reels

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Fewer than <strong>3</strong> trophies collected
- Bonus credits don't meet threshold for trophy count
- Playing above minimum bet level

---

STOP WHEN:

- Not noticing the game (look for motorcycle above machines)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/indian-motorcycle-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/indian-motorcycle-2.jpg - Seven of the eight gold trophies have been collected.
  Image 3: /images/games/indian-motorcycle-3.jpg - The player spins a bonus wheel after the eighth trophy has been collected.

GUIDE 51: JACKPOT CATCHER
==================================================

Category: accumulation
Volatility: medium
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
5+ ring value total (yellow = 1, green 2x = 2, pink 3x = 3, red 5x = 5)

STOP PLAYING:
After all rings deplete (3 spins each) and prizes are collected

HOW IT WORKS:
Jackpot Catcher (Sun / Moon) features **glowing rings** that lock on reels:

**Mechanic:**
- Glowing rings lock on reels for <strong>3</strong> spins
- Credit value lands in ring → Win that amount
- 3 internal segments show spins remaining
- Sun/Moon in active ring → Refills AND upgrades multiplier

**Ring Values:**
| Ring Color | Multiplier | Point Value |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| Yellow | 1x | 1 |
| Green | 2x | 2 |
| Pink | 3x | 3 |
| Red | 5x | 5 |

---

PLAY WHEN:
<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- Ring value total ≥ <strong>5</strong>

**Counting Examples:**
- 5 yellow rings = 5 points ✅
- 1 green (2) + 1 pink (3) = 5 points ✅
- 1 red (5) = 5 points ✅
- 2 green (4) + 1 yellow (1) = 5 points ✅

| Ring Total | Action |
|------------|--------|
| Below 5 | ❌ Walk away |
| 5+ | ✅ **Play** |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Ring value total below <strong>5</strong>
- All rings about to expire (0-1 segments remaining)
- Just triggered special Jackpot Catcher Spin

---

STOP WHEN:
- All rings deplete (3 spins each)
- Prizes collected
- Ring total drops below threshold

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Not counting ring multiplier values correctly
- Ignoring segment count (spins remaining)
- Not recognizing this game (most APs don't know it)
- Walking past common plays

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/jackpot-catcher-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/jackpot-catcher-2.jpg
  Image 3: /images/games/jackpot-catcher-3.jpg
  Image 4: /images/games/jackpot-catcher-4.jpg - It is actually fairly common to find walkup plays like this. The previous player won the mega (and mini) and then cashed out.
  Image 5: /images/games/jackpot-catcher-5.jpg - Triggering the special Jackpot Catcher Spin on an already full board is the best possible scenario.

GUIDE 52: Jewel Collection: Dragon / Vault
==================================================

Category: must-hit-by
Volatility: low
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Scatter meter at 480+ of 777 (above reel 2) | Total extra wilds across all 4 jewel meters at 610+ (bet pad shows 3 meters, check screen for amethyst)

STOP PLAYING:
After mystery free games triggers (scatter hits 777) | After any jewel bonus triggers (amethyst, sapphire, emerald, or ruby)

HOW IT WORKS:
Jewel Collection features **four jewel meters + scatter meter**:

**Jewel Meters (Extra Wilds):**
| Meter | Color | Reset Range | Cap |
|-------|-------|-------------|-----|
| Amethyst | Purple | 50-70 | 100 |
| Sapphire | Blue | 70-100 | 150 |
| Emerald | Green | 100-150 | 200 |
| Ruby | Red | 150-200 | 300 |

**Mechanic:**
- Jewel lands → +<strong>5</strong> wilds to corresponding meter
- Wilds added to reel strip (NOT guaranteed to land)
- Amethyst triggers randomly; others trigger with free games

**Scatter Meter (Must-Hit-By 777):**
- Located above reel 2
- Scatter symbol lands → Meter +1
- Guaranteed to trigger by <strong>777</strong>
- Awards mystery free games (sapphire, emerald, or ruby)
- Resets to 10, 30, 50, or 100

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — Scatter Meter:**
- Scatter meter at <strong>480+</strong> of 777

**Option B — Combined Jewel Wilds:**
- Total extra wilds across ALL 4 meters ≥ <strong>610</strong>

| Meter | Threshold | Where to Check |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Scatter | <strong>480+</strong> | Above reel 2 |
| Jewels combined | <strong>610+</strong> | Bet pad (3 meters) + screen (amethyst) |

**How to Check:**
- Bet pad shows: Sapphire, Emerald, Ruby
- Screen shows: Amethyst (check separately!)

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Scatter meter below <strong>480</strong>
- Combined jewel wilds below <strong>610</strong>
- Chasing individual jewel meters (not +EV alone)

---

STOP WHEN:
- Mystery free games triggers (scatter hits 777)
- Any jewel bonus triggers (amethyst, sapphire, emerald, or ruby)

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Thinking this plays like Regal Riches (very different)
- Chasing individual jewel meters (need combined total)
- Forgetting to check amethyst meter on screen (not on bet pad)
- Expecting consistent wins (very volatile)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/jewel-collection-dragon--vault-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/jewel-collection-dragon--vault-2.jpg
  Image 3: /images/games/jewel-collection-dragon--vault-3.jpg - During the bonus features, the extra wilds are added to the reel strips but are not guaranteed to actually land on the reels.
  Image 4: /images/games/jewel-collection-dragon--vault-4.jpg - You can get massive line hits when the wild symbols line up.
  Image 5: /images/games/jewel-collection-dragon--vault-5.jpg - The bonus features can be feast or famine.
  Image 6: /images/games/jewel-collection-dragon--vault-6.jpg - The bet pad shows the extra wilds accumulated in the sapphire, emerald and ruby meters, but you need to check the screen to see the wilds accumulated in the amethyst meter.
  Image 7: /images/games/jewel-collection-dragon--vault-7.jpg - The Dragon and Vault versions of Jewel Collection play the same for advantage purposes.

**Bat Locations:**
- Only appear on reels 2, 3, and 4

---

PLAY WHEN:
<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- Text shows "locked for 2 spins" OR "locked for 1 spin"

**Option A — Single Bat:**
- <strong>1</strong> locked bat on reels 2, 3, or 4
- With <strong>2+</strong> spins remaining

- Bats showing only <strong>1</strong> coin (disappear next spin)
- No "locked for X spins" text visible
- No locked bats present

---

STOP WHEN:

- Confusing with other Jin Ji Bao Xi games (different mechanics)
- Not checking "locked for X spins" text

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/jin-ji-bao-xi-grand-phoenix--tiger-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/jin-ji-bao-xi-grand-phoenix--tiger-2.jpg - The bat symbols in reels two and four will be locked for one additional spin (not two like the coins on the bats would lead you to believe).
  Image 3: /images/games/jin-ji-bao-xi-grand-phoenix--tiger-3.jpg - There are several different games in the Jin Ji Bao Xi series, but only the Phoenix and Tiger versions have the persistent bat symbols.

LOOK FOR:
Progressive at 85-90%+ of must-hit-by value (check help screen for specific MHB threshold)

STOP PLAYING:
After progressive jackpot triggers and resets | Check other bet levels before leaving

HOW IT WORKS:
Jin Ji Bao Xi: Rising Fortunes features a **must-hit-by progressive jackpot**:

**Mechanic:**
- Progressive meter accumulates with each spin
- Guaranteed to trigger before reaching maximum threshold
- Close to must-hit = Increased expected value

**Different from Other Jin Ji Bao Xi Games:**
- Rising Fortunes = Must-hit-by progressive
- Grand Phoenix/Tiger = Persistent bat symbols (counter-based)

**How to Check:**
- View progressive value on game display
- Check help screens/paytable for must-hit-by threshold

Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Bonus symbol in reel 2 with spin counter showing above reel 4 (do not play if symbol only in reel 4)

STOP PLAYING:
After bonus triggers or spin counter reaches 0

HOW IT WORKS:
Jurassic Park Trilogy features a **bonus triggered by symbols in reels 2 and 4**:

**Mechanic:**
- Bonus symbol lands in reel 2 OR reel 4
- Player gets <strong>5</strong> spins to land symbol in the OTHER reel
- Both symbols present → Bonus triggers

**Critical Difference:**
| Reel | Symbol Frequency |
|------|------------------|
| Reel 2 | **Hard** to land |
| Reel 4 | **Easy** to land |

---

PLAY WHEN:
<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- Bonus symbol **already in reel 2**
- Counter showing above reel 4

| Symbol Location | Counter Position | Action |
|-----------------|------------------|--------|
| Reel 2 | Above reel 4 | ✅ **Play** |
| Reel 4 | Above reel 2 | ❌ Skip |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Bonus symbol only in reel 4 (need to land in reel 2 = very hard)
- Counter at 0 or expired
- No bonus symbols visible

---

STOP WHEN:
- Bonus triggers (both symbols landed)
- Spin counter reaches 0

---

COMMON MISTAKES:

  Image 2: /images/games/jurassic-park-trilogy-2.jpg - Even with five spins remaining on the counter above reel two, it can be difficult to land the second bonus symbol.
  Image 3: /images/games/jurassic-park-trilogy-3.jpg - The bonus symbol is much easier to land in reel four, so this is a much better play.

GUIDE 56: KRAKEN UNLEASHED
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
2+ wood panels in top row (reels 1-4 only) | 1 panel in top row + 2+ in middle row | Aggressive: any panel in top row (unless stack of 4 just shifted off bottom)

STOP PLAYING:
After hold & spin bonus triggers | All panels shift off the bottom of the reels

HOW IT WORKS:
Kraken Unleashed (Lobster Bay / Wild Vikings / Dive for Five) features **wood panels** that shift down:

**Mechanic:**
- Wood panels with credit prizes land on reels 1-4 only
- Each spin → Panels shift **down one row**
- <strong>6</strong> panels visible → Triggers Hold & Spin bonus
- Panels often land in stacks up to 4 tall

**Panel Behavior:**
- Start in top row → Shift down each spin
- Exit screen from bottom row
- Smaller credit values = Taller stacks (more lucrative for bonus)

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — Top Row Panels:**
- <strong>2+</strong> wood panels in top row (reels 1-4)

**Option B — Split Position:**
- <strong>1</strong> panel in top row
- <strong>2+</strong> panels in middle row

**Option C — Aggressive (High RTP):**
- Any panel in top row
- ❌ **EXCEPT:** Stack of 4 just shifted, bottom panel exited (nothing above)

| Top Row Panels | Middle Row | Action |
|----------------|------------|--------|
| 2+ | Any | ✅ **Play** |
| 1 | 2+ | ✅ **Play** |
| 1 | 0-1 | ⚠️ Aggressive only |
| 0 | Any | ❌ Walk away |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- No panels in top row
- Stack of 4 just shifted off bottom (no more coming)
- Panels only in reels 5 (panels only appear reels 1-4)

---

STOP WHEN:
- Hold & Spin bonus triggers (<strong>6</strong> panels)
- All panels shift off bottom of reels
- No panels remaining in top/middle rows

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing panels in reel 5 (panels only appear reels 1-4)
- Playing after 4-tall stack bottom exits (nothing above)
- Not checking all 4 denominations
- Walking past this game (most APs don't know it)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/kraken-unleashed-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/kraken-unleashed-2.jpg - Kraken Unleashed comes in three themes—Lobster Bay, Wild Vikings and Dive for Five. The persistent state feature is exactly the same in all three versions.
  Image 3: /images/games/kraken-unleashed-3.jpg - A solid bonus with the mini jackpot.
  Image 4: /images/games/kraken-unleashed-4.jpg - Most of the times you hit the bonus will look like this, where the six wood panels all came down from the top in a big stack in two columns.
  Image 5: /images/games/kraken-unleashed-5.jpg - Large credit value amounts like this (20x the bet) usually are just single tiles and don’t come in stacks of three or four like the smaller credit values.
  Image 6: /images/games/kraken-unleashed-6.jpg - Sometimes a bunch of wood panels will just randomly land on the reels like this, but it’s not very common.
  Image 7: /images/games/kraken-unleashed-7.jpg - Finding walk-up plays like this will give you an excellent chance of landing the bonus.
  Image 8: /images/games/kraken-unleashed-8.jpg - The bonus can pay out very nicely, especially when you fill the board and land the multiplier.

GUIDE 57: LEGEND OF THE 3X 2X PHOENIX
==================================================

Category: must-hit-by
Volatility: low
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Any meter at 14 (red/green/blue must-hit at 15) | On 91%+ RTP machines: green at 13 is also playable

STOP PLAYING:
After free games meter triggers at 15

HOW IT WORKS:
Legend of the 3X 2X Phoenix / Triple Double Diamond features **three must-hit-by meters** at 15:

**Meter Types:**
| Meter | Reset Value | Multiplier | Behavior |
|-------|-------------|------------|----------|
| Red | 5 | 2x | Rarely reaches 14 (hits early) |
| Green | 7 | 5x | Often hits early |
| Blue | 10 | 10x | Usually goes to 15 |

**Unique Mechanic:**
- Meters increment at fixed rate based on spins
- RTP setting determines spins needed per increment
- Flames appear when past average hit point

---

PLAY WHEN:
<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- Any meter at <strong>14</strong>

**91%+ RTP Machines:**
- Green (5x) at <strong>13</strong> is also playable

| Meter | Count | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Any | 14 | ✅ **Play** |
| Green | 13 | ✅ **Play** (91%+ RTP only) |
| Any | Below 13 | ❌ Walk away |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- All meters below <strong>14</strong>
- 85-87% RTP machine with fresh 14 (wait for buildup)
- Taking game at 13 (rarely profitable)

---

STOP WHEN:
- Free games meter triggers at <strong>15</strong>
- Meter resets to starting value

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing at 13 (rarely profitable)
- Playing fresh 14s on low RTP (85-87%) machines
- Not knowing RTP affects profitability significantly
- Expecting blue (10x) to always work out (can still lose)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/legend-of-the-3x-2x-phoenix-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/legend-of-the-3x-2x-phoenix-2.jpg
  Image 3: /images/games/legend-of-the-3x-2x-phoenix-3.jpg - The red meter resets to 5 and pays at 2x, the green meter resets to 7 and pays at 5x and the blue meter resets to 10 and pays at 10x.
  Image 4: /images/games/legend-of-the-3x-2x-phoenix-4.jpg - The free games feature can be very volatile—this was an excellent win on 15 blue with a 334x payout.
  Image 5: /images/games/legend-of-the-3x-2x-phoenix-5.jpg - Look for the large screen sticking out above the machine to easily spot these games in casinos.

GUIDE 58: Let’s Spin / Let’s Spin Vegas
==================================================

Category: cycle-based
Volatility: medium
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Let

STOP PLAYING:
After wheel spin bonus completes | All Let

HOW IT WORKS:
Let's Spin / Let's Spin Vegas features **persistent Let's and Spin symbols**:

**Mechanic:**
- Let's (reel 1) + Spin (reel 2) together → Triggers wheel spin
- Symbols persist for <strong>3</strong> spins after landing
- Symbols land in any row → Move to top → Down one row per spin
- Additional Spin symbols in reels 3-4-5 → Add extra multipliers

**Multiplier Rings (Multiply Together):**
| Ring | Reel | Max Multiplier | Jackpot |
|------|------|----------------|---------|
| 1st | 2 | 4x | Mini |
| 2nd | 3 | 5x | Minor |
| 3rd | 4 | 8x | Major |
| 4th | 5 | 10x | Mega |

**Max Combined:** 4x × 5x × 8x × 10x = <strong>1,600x</strong>

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — Let's Symbol:**
- Let's symbol in reel 1
- **NOT on bottom row**

**Option B — Spin Symbol in Reel 2:**
- Spin symbol in reel 2
- **NOT on bottom row**

**Option C — Multiple Spin Symbols:**
- Spin symbols in **both** reels 3 and 4
- **NOT on bottom row**

| Symbol | Reel | Row | Action |
|--------|------|-----|--------|
| Let's | 1 | Top/Middle | ✅ **Play** |
| Let's | 1 | Bottom | ❌ Skip |
| Spin | 2 | Top/Middle | ✅ **Play** |
| Spin | 2 | Bottom | ❌ Skip |
| Spin | 3+4 | Top/Middle | ✅ **Play** |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Symbols only on bottom row (likely disappear next spin)
- No Let's or Spin symbols visible

---

STOP WHEN:
- Wheel spin bonus completes
- All Let's/Spin symbols move off bottom row

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing bottom row symbols (can't tell if first or last appearance)
- Not recognizing multipliers MULTIPLY (not add)
- Missing massive combined multiplier opportunities

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/lets-spin--lets-spin-vegas-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/lets-spin--lets-spin-vegas-2.jpg - The reels connect to the concentric rings above that contain the multipliers.
  Image 3: /images/games/lets-spin--lets-spin-vegas-3.jpg - This is an excellent play. Landing a Spin symbol in the second reel will trigger a wheel spin with two multipliers.
  Image 4: /images/games/lets-spin--lets-spin-vegas-4.jpg - This is a riskier play as you need to land both a Let's symbol in reel one and a Spin symbol in reel two. But if you do, you'll get a massive win with three combined multipliers.
  Image 5: /images/games/lets-spin--lets-spin-vegas-5.jpg - Even with just one 3x multiplier, you can still get decent payouts.

GUIDE 59: Life of Luxury Hot Diamonds
==================================================

Category: must-hit-by
Volatility: low
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Car at 40+ | Boat at 50+ | Plane at 65+ (check bet pad for all meter levels)

STOP PLAYING:
After free games bonus triggers (land 3 symbols, spin wheel)

HOW IT WORKS:
Life of Luxury Hot Diamonds features **three progressive free games meters** (NOT must-hit-by):

**Meter Types:**
| Meter | Symbol | Luxury Zones | Reset Value |
|-------|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Car | Car | 1 (single) | ~10 |
| Boat | Boat | 2 (double) | ~10 |
| Plane | Plane | 3 (triple) | ~10 |

**Mechanic:**
- Symbol lands → Corresponding meter increases
- 3 scatter symbols → Spin wheel to determine which bonus
- Completely random when bonus triggers (NOT must-hit-by)

---

PLAY WHEN:
| Meter | Free Games Threshold |
|-------|---------------------|
| Car | ≥ <strong>40</strong> |
| Boat | ≥ <strong>50</strong> |
| Plane | ≥ <strong>65</strong> |

- Shows free games count for all bet levels

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Car below <strong>40</strong> free games
- Boat below <strong>50</strong> free games
- Plane below <strong>65</strong> free games
- Chasing gem progressives above reels (not worth it)
- You are a newer AP with limited bankroll

---

STOP WHEN:
- Free games bonus triggers (3 symbols, spin wheel)
- You hit your loss limit (set one before playing)

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Thinking more spins = closer to hitting (NOT TRUE)
- Chasing without adequate bankroll
- Chasing gem progressives (not worth it)
- Not setting a loss limit before playing

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/life-of-luxury-hot-diamonds-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/life-of-luxury-hot-diamonds-2.jpg - All of the themes in this series feature a car, a boat and a plane, regardless of whether it actually matches the setting of the game.
  Image 3: /images/games/life-of-luxury-hot-diamonds-3.jpg - You can look directly on the bet pad to see the number of free games on all bet levels.

GUIDE 60: LUCKY EMPRESS / INCA EMPRESS
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Active 10x or 12x multiplier (shows

STOP PLAYING:
After multiplier triggers on a line hit and no 10x+ total remains active or queued

HOW IT WORKS:
Lucky Empress / Inca Empress features **persistent multipliers** on the left side of rows:

**Mechanic:**
- Tiles with ? land → Move to tile placeholders on left
- <strong>3</strong> tiles collected → Reveals multipliers (2x, 3x, 5x, 8x, 10x, or 12x)
- Bottom multiplier becomes **active** ("X NEXT PAY" shown)
- Line hit on that row → Multiplier applies and disappears
- Next multiplier in queue becomes active

**Tile Appearance:**
| Game | Tile Shape |
|------|------------|
| Lucky Empress | Diamond |
| Inca Empress | Circle |

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — High Active Multiplier:**
- Active <strong>10x</strong> or <strong>12x</strong> multiplier

**Option B — Combined Active Multipliers:**
- Active multipliers totaling ≥ <strong>10x</strong>
- Examples: 5x + 5x = 10x | 8x + 3x = 11x

**Option C — Queue Setup:**
- <strong>10x</strong> or <strong>12x</strong> in upcoming queue
- Play through 5x or 8x in front to reach them

| Active Multiplier | Queue | Action |
|-------------------|-------|--------|
| 10x or 12x | Any | ✅ **Play** |
| 5x+5x or similar | Any | ✅ **Play** |
| 5x or 8x | 10x/12x behind | ✅ **Play** |
| Below 10x total | No 10x/12x queued | ❌ Skip |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Active multipliers total below <strong>10x</strong>
- No 10x/12x in queue
- Only question mark tiles (not revealed)
- 2x or 3x multipliers only

---

STOP WHEN:
- Multiplier triggers on line hit
- No <strong>10x+</strong> total remains active or queued

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Chasing question mark tiles (might reveal worthless 2x/3x)
- Perpetually chasing small multipliers (they come up frequently)
- Expecting every play to profit (most lose, big wins cover losses)
- Skipping this game entirely (solid play with right rules)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/lucky-empress--inca-empress-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/lucky-empress--inca-empress-3.jpg - The free games feature can pay big even on small bets, but it can often disappoint as well.
  Image 3: /images/games/lucky-empress--inca-empress-4.jpg - Never play in situations like this where the multipliers are not yet revealed.

GUIDE 61: LUCKY LARRY
==================================================

Category: accumulation
Volatility: medium
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
1 coin in each of 3 Loot Awards (above reels 2, 3, 4) | Bonus Loot Award present on any reel (any coin count) | Jackpot Loot Award with 1+ coins | Active Loot Award showing spins remaining

STOP PLAYING:
After triggering any Loot Award

HOW IT WORKS:
Lucky Larry's Lobstermania 4 Link / Super Sally's Shrimpmania 4 Link features **Loot Awards** above reels 2, 3, and 4:

**Mechanic:**
- <strong>2</strong> coins collected → Loot Award activates
- Coins appear as sub-symbols (don't block regular symbols)
- Coins land frequently → Low investment usually

**Loot Award Types:**
| Type | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Bonus | Best | Always play if present |
| Jackpot | High variance | Can bust but huge potential |
| Others | Good | Standard awards |

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — Three Reels Setup:**
- <strong>1</strong> coin in each of 3 Loot Awards (reels 2, 3, 4)
- Stop after triggering one

**Option B — Active Loot Award:**
- Shows "2 Spins Left" or "1 Spin Left"

**Option C — Bonus Loot Award:**
- Bonus present on any reel
- **Any coin count** (even 0)

**Option D — Jackpot Loot Award:**
- Jackpot present with <strong>1+</strong> coins
- (0 coins is +EV but high variance)

**Option E — Completed Awards (1 Spin Gamble):**

Play 1 spin to see if Jackpot/Bonus replaces it:
- 1 completed + 1 coin in other two
- 2 completed awards
- 3 completed awards (rare)

*(Only if completed awards are NOT Jackpot/Bonus)*

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- No coins and no special Loot Awards (Bonus/Jackpot)
- Just triggered a Loot Award (re-evaluate)

---

STOP WHEN:
- Any Loot Award triggers
- Re-evaluate remaining awards

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Not recognizing Bonus Loot Award (always play)
- Waiting for coins on Jackpot Loot Award (0 coins is +EV)
- Not checking all three Loot Award positions

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/lucky-larrys-lobstermania-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/lucky-larrys-lobstermania-2.jpg - This is a solid play with one coin collected in each of the Loot Awards above reels two, three and four.
  Image 3: /images/games/lucky-larrys-lobstermania-3.jpg
  Image 4: /images/games/lucky-larrys-lobstermania-4.jpg - Combining the Wild Stacks Loot Award with the King Stacks Loot Award can lead to nice wins such as this.
  Image 5: /images/games/lucky-larrys-lobstermania-5.jpg - The Wild Stacks Loot Award can also be combined with the Double Symbols Loot Award.
  Image 6: /images/games/lucky-larrys-lobstermania-6.jpg - Always play if there is a Bonus Loot Award present, as shown at the top of reel two.
  Image 7: /images/games/lucky-larrys-lobstermania-7.jpg
  Image 8: /images/games/lucky-larrys-lobstermania-8.jpg - The bucket bonus usually gives a solid payout, as opposed to the free games bonus, which is much more volatile.

GUIDE 62: Lucky Pick: Bumble Bee / Cash Tree / Leprechaun
==================================================

Category: cycle-based
Volatility: medium
Min Bet: $30

LOOK FOR:
3 wilds revealed | 2 wilds + multiplier, 4+ free games, or 5+ credits revealed | 1 wild + 10 or fewer picks remaining | 7 or fewer picks remaining (any setup)

STOP PLAYING:
After free games bonus triggers (keep playing until bonus - never stop early)

HOW IT WORKS:
Lucky Pick features a **21-pick board with free games bonus**:

**Mechanic:**
- Board has <strong>21</strong> covered picks above reels
- Lucky Pick symbol lands → Reveal one pick
- Picks = Credit prizes (instant) OR upgrades (for free games)
- <strong>3</strong> scatter symbols → Triggers free games bonus
- After bonus: Board resets with 3 random non-credit picks revealed

**Free Games Default Values:**
- 3 free games
- 1 random wild added to reels 2-5 each spin
- 2x multiplier on all wins

---

PLAY WHEN:
N/A

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- No wilds revealed + many picks remaining
- Only on Board B with no wilds (worst board)
- Insufficient bankroll for the bet level

---

STOP WHEN:
- Free games bonus triggers
- **NEVER stop before bonus** (keep playing until bonus!)

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Stopping before free games bonus (loses all equity)
- Overvaluing free games picks vs wild picks
- Playing without adequate bankroll
- Not recognizing which board you're on

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/lucky-pick-bumble-bee--cash-tree--leprechaun-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/lucky-pick-bumble-bee--cash-tree--leprechaun-2.jpg - Landing the Lucky Pick symbol (shown in the middle reel) will let you choose one of the picks on the board above (there are only two picks remaining).
  Image 3: /images/games/lucky-pick-bumble-bee--cash-tree--leprechaun-3.jpg - After the free games bonus ends, the board is reset and three random non-credit picks are revealed. This is the best possible reset scenario, with three wilds revealed.
  Image 4: /images/games/lucky-pick-bumble-bee--cash-tree--leprechaun-4.jpg - During the free games bonus, you can get massive line hits thanks to the wilds and multipliers.
  Image 5: /images/games/lucky-pick-bumble-bee--cash-tree--leprechaun-5.jpg
  Image 6: /images/games/lucky-pick-bumble-bee--cash-tree--leprechaun-6.jpg
  Image 7: /images/games/lucky-pick-bumble-bee--cash-tree--leprechaun-7.jpg - This is the worst possible setup you can find with two wilds revealed. I would skip this play unless I knew I was on a higher RTP or if I was trying to build points.
  Image 8: /images/games/lucky-pick-bumble-bee--cash-tree--leprechaun-8.jpg
  Image 9: /images/games/lucky-pick-bumble-bee--cash-tree--leprechaun-9.jpg - We know we are on board D here because there are 10 credit picks revealed. Therefore, there is another wild remaining and we have a good chance of revealing it because there are only five picks left.
  Image 10: /images/games/lucky-pick-bumble-bee--cash-tree--leprechaun-10.jpg - Plays like this might look tempting because there are a lot of picks revealed, but I would skip this because there are no wilds.
  Image 11: /images/games/lucky-pick-bumble-bee--cash-tree--leprechaun-11.jpg - This is a common type of play that you will find. It might look promising because of the three multipliers, but with just one wild, it is too risky.
  Image 12: /images/games/lucky-pick-bumble-bee--cash-tree--leprechaun-12.jpg
  Image 13: /images/games/lucky-pick-bumble-bee--cash-tree--leprechaun-13.jpg - With just one wild, this is a mediocre play. But with only 10 picks remaining, plays like these are +EV over the long run.
  Image 14: /images/games/lucky-pick-bumble-bee--cash-tree--leprechaun-14.jpg - We know we are on board B here because of the two +3 free games. Board B is the lowest-paying board and there are 14 picks remaining, so I would pass on this play.
  Image 15: /images/games/lucky-pick-bumble-bee--cash-tree--leprechaun-15.jpg - I would never play a setup like this. We know we are on the worst-paying board (B) and there are no wilds revealed.
  Image 16: /images/games/lucky-pick-bumble-bee--cash-tree--leprechaun-16.jpg - This is another example of a board that I would never play. It’s too early to determine what board we are on, but without any wilds, it is way too risky.

GUIDE 63: LUNAR DISC / FORTUNE DISC
==================================================

Category: accumulation
Volatility: medium
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
5 discs collected (check bet pad counter - bonus triggers at 6)

STOP PLAYING:
After disc bonus triggers (random symbol turns wild)

HOW IT WORKS:
Lunar Disc / Fortune Disc features **disc collection** that triggers a bonus:

**Mechanic:**
- Discs land on reels → Collected
- <strong>6</strong> discs collected → Triggers bonus
- Bonus: Random symbol turns WILD (all instances)
- If disc lands on disc → Additional disc added, spins again

**Bet Level Starting Discs:**
| Bet Level | Starting Discs |
|-----------|----------------|
| 75 credits | 0 |
| 300 credits | 3 |

---

PLAY WHEN:
<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- Discs collected: <strong>5</strong>

**How to Check:**
- Look **directly on bet pad**

| Discs | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 0–4 | ❌ Walk away |
| 5 | ✅ **Play** |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Discs below <strong>5</strong>
- Just triggered bonus (discs reset)
- Playing at 4 discs (claimed +EV but unproven)

---

STOP WHEN:
- Disc bonus triggers
- Random symbol turns wild

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing at 4 discs (not confirmed +EV)
- Not checking bet pad for disc count
- Expecting every bonus to pay well (varies)
- Not checking all denominations

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/lunar-disc--fortune-disc-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/lunar-disc--fortune-disc-2.jpg - The disc counter is at five, so this is a solid play.
  Image 3: /images/games/lunar-disc--fortune-disc-3.jpg - Getting multiple discs active during the feature can lead to nice wins such as this.
  Image 4: /images/games/lunar-disc--fortune-disc-4.jpg
  Image 5: /images/games/lunar-disc--fortune-disc-5.jpg - Fortune Disc is a less common clone of Lunar Disc.

GUIDE 64: MADONNA : MIGHTY CASH
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Total multipliers 21x or higher (add all 5 reel multipliers, max 8x each)

STOP PLAYING:
After Mighty Cash bonus triggers (multipliers reset)

HOW IT WORKS:
Madonna: Mighty Cash features **accumulating multipliers for Mighty Cash bonus**:

**Mechanic:**
- Boost symbol lands → Multiplier above that reel +1x
- Max multiplier: <strong>8x</strong> per reel
- <strong>6+</strong> star symbols → Triggers Mighty Cash hold-and-spin bonus
- Credit prizes in bonus are pre-multiplied by reel multiplier

**Multiplier Reset:**
- After Mighty Cash bonus triggers
- A few random multipliers added to entice further play

---

PLAY WHEN:
<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- Total of ALL multipliers ≥ <strong>21x</strong>

**How to Calculate:**
- Add all 5 reel multipliers together
- Example: 5x + 4x + 3x + 5x + 4x = 21x ✅

| Total Multipliers | Action |
|-------------------|--------|
| 21x+ | ✅ **Play** |
| Below 21x | ❌ Walk away |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Total multipliers below <strong>21x</strong>

---

STOP WHEN:
- Mighty Cash bonus triggers (multipliers reset)

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Not adding ALL 5 reel multipliers
- Playing close-but-not-quite setups (like 18x)
- Not bringing adequate bankroll

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/madonna-mighty-cash-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/madonna-mighty-cash-2.jpg - The total value of all multipliers is 18x, so this isn’t quite a play. It’s close enough that most hustlers would probably take it though.
  Image 3: /images/games/madonna-mighty-cash-3.jpg - This is an excellent play on a $15 bet with the total value of the multipliers at 33x.


==================================================
GUIDE 65: MAGIC WISHES
==================================================

Category: accumulation
Volatility: medium
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Check spin counter (X of 10) and count locked frames aligned horizontally on the same row | Later spins (7-9) need fewer frames | earlier spins (1-6) need 3-4+ frames on same row | Frames on left reels are more valuable

STOP PLAYING:
After 10th spin completes (all accumulated frames turn wild)

HOW IT WORKS:
Magic Wishes operates on a **10-game cycle** with frame collection:

**Mechanic:**
- Lamp lands → Creates locked frames
- Frames accumulate through 10-game cycle
- Spin 10 → All accumulated frames turn WILD
- Lamp occasionally shoots out multiple frames (volatile)

**Goal:** Frames lined up horizontally for 4-of-a-kind or 5-of-a-kind

---

PLAY WHEN:
N/A

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Game <strong>10</strong> of 10 (NEVER)
- Frames not aligned horizontally (late in cycle)
- Only 3-of-a-kind possible (pays poorly)

---

STOP WHEN:
- Spin 10 completes
- All frames turn wild
- Cycle resets

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing game 10 of 10
- Expecting 3-of-a-kind to pay well (aim for 4+ of a kind)
- Not prioritizing horizontal alignment late in cycle
- Not recognizing lamp can shoot multiple frames (volatile)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/magic-wishes-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/magic-wishes-2.jpg - The game counter on the bottom right shows this game is on spin 4 of 10. Landing the lamp symbol creates the locked frames. These frames accumulate up until spin ten, when they all will turn wild.
  Image 3: /images/games/magic-wishes-3.jpg - Five-of-a-kind wilds pay very well, as you can see on this $16.41 win on a $0.75 bet.

After Volcano Bonus triggers

HOW IT WORKS:
Mammoth Legend features **coin elimination for guaranteed Volcano Bonus**:

**Mechanic:**
- Bonus symbol lands fully in reel 5 → Pick from 5 coins
- 1 coin = Volcano Bonus, 4 coins = Credit prizes
- Pick credit prize → That coin removed for next time
- <strong>1</strong> coin remaining → Guaranteed Volcano Bonus next pick

---

PLAY WHEN:
<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- <strong>1</strong> coin remaining above reel 5
- Screen displays: **"Next Bonus = Guaranteed Jackpot!"**

| Coins Remaining | Action |
|-----------------|--------|
| 1 (Guaranteed Jackpot) | ✅ **Play** (risky) |
| 2+ | ❌ Skip |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- More than 1 coin remaining
- No "Guaranteed Jackpot" message

---

STOP WHEN:
- Volcano Bonus triggers

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing with multiple coins remaining
- Not having adequate bankroll for variance
- Expecting guaranteed profit (can still lose with mini jackpot)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/mammoth-legend-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/mammoth-legend-2.jpg - You are looking for one coin remaining directly above reel five.
  Image 3: /images/games/mammoth-legend-3.jpg - Once there is only one coin remaining, you are guaranteed to get the Volcano Bonus on your next pick.
  Image 4: /images/games/mammoth-legend-4.jpg - In the Volcano Bonus, you are guaranteed to win one of the jackpots. If you only get the mini, then you are likely to lose money on the play.
  Image 5: /images/games/mammoth-legend-5.jpg - The Mammoth Bonus can pay very well, especially if you get a multiplier.

GUIDE 67: Miss Kitty Wild Ride
==================================================

Category: cycle-based
Volatility: medium
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Wild Ride Bonus active (larger reels visible) | Miss Kitty: diamonds behind reels | Zorro: flames behind reels

STOP PLAYING:
Reels shrink back to normal size (no wild or multiplier landed on previous spin)

HOW IT WORKS:
Miss Kitty Wild Ride / Zorro Wild Ride features the **Wild Ride Bonus**:

**Mechanic:**
- Wild symbols and multipliers stay for 1 additional spin
- Continues as long as wild/multiplier lands each spin
- No wild/multiplier → Reels shrink, feature ends
- Wild Ride Bonus triggers ~once every <strong>30</strong> spins

**Visual Indicators:**
| Game | Active Indicator |
|------|------------------|
| Miss Kitty Wild Ride | Larger reels + diamonds behind |
| Zorro Wild Ride | Larger reels + flames behind |

---

PLAY WHEN:
<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- Wild Ride Bonus is **active**

**How to Identify:**
- Reels are **larger than normal**
- Special animation behind reels (diamonds or flames)

| Feature Status | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| Wild Ride Bonus active | ✅ **Play** |
| Normal reels (no bonus) | ❌ Walk away |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Normal sized reels (no Wild Ride Bonus)
- No diamonds (Miss Kitty) or flames (Zorro) behind reels

---

STOP WHEN:
- Reels shrink back to normal size
- No wild or multiplier landed on previous spin
- Feature ends

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing when Wild Ride Bonus is NOT active
- Not recognizing the larger reel visual indicator
- Not checking all denominations

---

IMAGES:

GUIDE 68: MOON SPIRIT
==================================================

Category: cycle-based
Volatility: medium
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Locked frames accumulated mid-cycle with spins remaining (check spin counter vs frame count in table below) | Frames on reels 2-3 most valuable (lady symbol expands wilds horizontally)

STOP PLAYING:
After 10th spin completes (all frames turn wild + horizontal expansion resolves)

HOW IT WORKS:
Moon Spirit operates on a **10-game cycle with horizontally expanding wilds**:

**Mechanic:**
- <strong>10</strong> game cycle
- Frames lock during cycle
- Spin 10: ALL locked frames turn wild
- Lady symbol in frame on spin 10 → Expands wilds horizontally (left + right)

**Key Difference from Scarab:**
- More volatile final spin
- Frames on reels 2-3 much more valuable (horizontal expansion)
- Vertical stacks valuable (can expand lady symbols left/right)

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Frames in First 3 Reels Required (by spin):**

| Spin | Frames Needed (Reels 1-3) |
|------|---------------------------|
| 10 of 10 | ❌ Never |
| 9 of 10 | <strong>1</strong> |
| 8-7 of 10 | <strong>2</strong> |
| 6-5 of 10 | <strong>3</strong> |
| 4-3 of 10 | <strong>4</strong> |
| 2-1 of 10 | <strong>5</strong> |

**Alternative Plays (Spins 6-5):**
- <strong>2</strong> frames in reels 2 AND 3
- <strong>3</strong> horizontally connected frames starting in reel 1 or 2

**Alternative Plays (Spins 4-3):**
- <strong>3</strong> frames in reels 2 AND 3
- <strong>3</strong> horizontally connected frames starting in reel 1 or 2

**Alternative Plays (Spins 2-1):**
- <strong>4</strong> frames in reels 2 AND 3
- <strong>3</strong> horizontally connected frames starting in reel 1 or 2

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Spin 10 of 10 (too late)
- Fewer frames than threshold for spin position
- Frames only in reels 4-5 (less valuable)

---

STOP WHEN:
- 10th spin completes (frames turn wild, expansion resolves)

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing spin 10 of 10 (no value left)
- Not prioritizing reels 2-3 for frames
- Ignoring horizontal connection opportunities
- Treating this like Scarab (different mechanics)

---

GUIDE 69: OCEAN MAGIC GRAND
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Wild bubbles in reels 2-3 (any row including sunrise below bottom) | Reel 1 + reel 4 bubbles within 1-2 rows of each other | Sunrise bubbles in reels 1 or 4 (play 1 spin for foghorn or additional bubbles)

STOP PLAYING:
When any bubble reaches 2nd row from top (1 spin remaining)

HOW IT WORKS:
Ocean Magic Grand features **wild bubbles that move UP**:

**Mechanic:**
- Wild bubbles move UP one row every spin
- Bubble lands on Ocean Magic symbol → ALL surrounding symbols turn wild
- Expansion: symbols above, below, left, right (if room)

**Key Differences from Regular Ocean Magic:**
- 50% taller reels
- Play tighter (single bubbles worth less)
- Multiple bubbles = Even bigger win potential

**Strategy is SAME for Regular and Bubble Boost modes.**

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — Reels 2-3 (Most Valuable):**
- Wild bubbles in reels 2 or 3
- Include "sunrise" bubbles below bottom row
- Stop when bubble reaches 2nd row from top

**Option B — Reels 1 + 4 Combo:**
- Bubble in reel 1 AND bubble in reel 4
- Bubbles within 1-2 rows of each other
- Stop when either reaches 2nd row from top

**Option C — Sunrise Bubbles (Test Spin):**
- Sunrise bubble in reel 1 or 4
- Play 1 spin to check for foghorn or additional bubbles

| Bubble Location | Action |
|-----------------|--------|
| Reels 2-3 (any row including sunrise) | ✅ **Play** |
| Reel 1 + Reel 4 (aligned) | ✅ **Play** |
| Sunrise in reel 1 or 4 | ✅ **1 spin test** |
| Reel 5 only | ❌ Skip (mostly worthless) |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Bubble reaches 2nd row from top (only 1 spin remaining)
- Only reel 5 bubbles
- Single bubble in reel 1 without reel 4 partner

---

STOP WHEN:
- Bubble reaches 2nd row from top (1 spin remaining)

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Not checking sunrise bubbles (often overlooked)
- Playing single reel 1 bubbles without reel 4 partner
- Not stopping when bubble reaches 2nd-from-top row
- Confusing expanded wilds with real bubbles

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/ocean-magic-grand-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/ocean-magic-grand-2.jpg - This is an excellent walk-up play that I found. Bubbles often come in big spurts like this.
  Image 3: /images/games/ocean-magic-grand-3.jpg
  Image 4: /images/games/ocean-magic-grand-4.jpg - Getting multiple wild bubbles to expand at once can lead to huge wins like this.
  Image 5: /images/games/ocean-magic-grand-5.jpg - The free games bonus is tough to land, but it can pay very well.

GUIDE 70: OCEAN MAGIC
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Wild bubbles in reels 1-4 (any row including sunrise bubbles below bottom row) | Same strategy for regular and Bubble Boost modes

STOP PLAYING:
All bubbles move off screen (check for sunrise bubbles below bottom row before leaving)

HOW IT WORKS:
Ocean Magic / Fu Ru Dong Hai features **wild bubbles** that move up:

**Mechanic:**
- Wild bubbles move **up one row** every spin
- Bubble lands on Ocean Magic symbol → All surrounding symbols turn wild
- Bubbles exit screen from top row
- Same strategy for Regular and Bubble Boost modes

**Bubble Value by Position:**
| Reel | Value |
|------|-------|
| Reels 2-3 | Most valuable (more room to expand) |
| Reel 4 | Valuable |
| Reel 5 | Mostly worthless |

---

PLAY WHEN:
<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- Wild bubbles in **reels 1-4** (any row)
- Include **sunrise bubbles** (below bottom row)

**Same Strategy for Both Modes:**
- Regular mode ✅
- Bubble Boost mode ✅

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Check for sunrise bubbles below bottom row—often overlooked.

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Bubbles only in reel 5 (mostly worthless)
- No bubbles visible (including sunrise position)
- All bubbles in top row only (exit next spin)

---

STOP WHEN:
- All bubbles move off screen
- ⚠️ **CHECK:** Sunrise bubbles below bottom row before leaving

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Missing sunrise bubbles below bottom row (most overlooked)
- Ignoring reel 4 bubbles (still valuable)
- Playing reel 5 bubbles alone (avoid this)
- Confusing expanded wilds with actual bubbles after expansion

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/ocean-magic-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/ocean-magic-2.jpg - Having five wild bubbles on the same row is an amazing situation. Bubbles often come in big spurts like this.

  Image 5: /images/games/ocean-magic-5.jpg
  Image 6: /images/games/ocean-magic-6.jpg - Fu Ru Dong Hai is an Asian-themed clone of Ocean Magic. It’s not nearly as common as the original Ocean Magic, but you can still find it in some casinos.

Category: must-hit-by
Volatility: low
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
$500 MHB at $481+ | $5,000 MHB at $4,929+ (weighted to hit near top, realistic chance at $490+ and $4,990+)

STOP PLAYING:
After MHB jackpot hits (resets to $200 or $4,000)

HOW IT WORKS:
Phoenix 888 Dragon features **two must-hit-by progressive jackpots**:

| Jackpot | Must Hit By | Resets To | Realistic Chance At |
|---------|-------------|-----------|---------------------|
| Mini | $500 | $200 | $490+ |
| Major | $5,000 | $4,000 | $4,990+ |

**Weighted to Top:** Jackpots almost always hit near maximum. Hitting early is exceedingly rare.

---

PLAY WHEN:
| Progressive | Play At (Conservative) |
|-------------|------------------------|
| $500 MHB | ≥ <strong>$481</strong> |
| $5,000 MHB | ≥ <strong>$4,929</strong> |

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Always **min bet** to reduce variance.

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- $500 below <strong>$481</strong>
- $5,000 below <strong>$4,929</strong>
- Max betting (too much variance)
- Bankroll below <strong>5x</strong> jackpot value

---

STOP WHEN:

- Progressive resets

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Max betting (can lose thousands on bad run)
- Taking play too early hoping to get lucky
- Playing $5,000 without considering taxes
- Not using player's card (losing points)
- Insufficient bankroll

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/phoenix-888-dragon-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/phoenix-888-dragon-2.jpg - The bottom MHB $500 progressive usually hits at a random point between $490 and $499.99, so it is likely to hit soon.

==================================================

Category: accumulation
Volatility: medium
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
3 or fewer pigs remaining (count large pig on top + smaller pigs below) | Verify you have the correct version matching the photos

STOP PLAYING:
After jackpot pick bonus triggers (lucky coin found)

HOW IT WORKS:
Piggy Bankin' features a **jackpot pick bonus** with the following mechanics:

- <strong>510</strong> total coins spread across <strong>9</strong> piggy banks
- <strong>1</strong> lucky coin hidden randomly triggers the bonus
- Landing multiplier symbols → Coins added to bank
- After <strong>60</strong> coins collected → Large pig breaks, smaller pig walks up
- Fewer pigs = **Higher chance** of finding lucky coin

---

PLAY WHEN:
<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- Total pigs remaining: ≤ <strong>3</strong>

<strong>Before Playing:</strong>
- Verify game version matches guide photos
- Count ALL pigs (top + bottom)

- Confusing this with Lock It Link version

---

  Image 1: /images/games/piggy-bankin-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/piggy-bankin-2.jpg
  Image 3: /images/games/piggy-bankin-3.jpg - There are now eight pigs remaining. You can see the outline of the pig that marched up from the bottom.
  Image 4: /images/games/piggy-bankin-4.jpg - Landing these multiplier symbols adds coins to the piggy bank.
  Image 5: /images/games/piggy-bankin-5.jpg - The jackpot pick bonus is triggered after you find the lucky coin.

GUIDE 73: Pillars of Cash: Celestial Fortune / Festive Fortune
==================================================

Category: accumulation
Volatility: medium
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
2 or more gold dragons anywhere | 1 gold dragon in reel 1 or 5 at 10x+ bet | 1 gold dragon in reel 2 or 4 at 40x+ bet

STOP PLAYING:
After pillar prize is awarded (or spins expire without landing a coin)

HOW IT WORKS:
Pillars of Cash features **pillars that build credit prizes with gold dragon triggers**:

**Mechanic:**
- Coin lands → Prize added to pillar, may increase height
- 3 green dots = Spins remaining at current height
- No dots + no coin = Pillar drops one level
- Pillar hits top → Dragon turns **GOLD**
- Coin lands on gold dragon reel → Chance to win prize

**Pillar Heights for Gold Dragon:**
| Reel | Height Required | Prize Size | Difficulty |
|------|-----------------|------------|------------|
| 1, 5 | 4 high | Smallest | Easiest |
| 2, 4 | 5 high | Larger | Much harder |
| 3 | 6 high | Largest | Extremely hard |

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Note:** Can play gold dragons even without green dots—coin resets counter.

**Option A — Two Gold Dragons:**
- <strong>2</strong> or more gold dragons anywhere

**Option B — Single Gold Dragon (Reel 1 or 5):**
- Prize at least <strong>10x</strong> bet

**Option C — Single Gold Dragon (Reel 2 or 4):**
- Prize at least <strong>40x</strong> bet

| Setup | Prize Threshold | Action |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| 2+ gold dragons | Any | ✅ **Play** |
| 1 gold (reel 1/5) | <strong>10x+</strong> bet | ✅ **Play** |
| 1 gold (reel 2/4) | <strong>40x+</strong> bet | ✅ **Play** |
| 1 gold (reel 3) | ❌ Too difficult | Skip |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Single gold dragon below prize threshold
- No gold dragons
- Middle reel gold dragon only (extremely difficult)

---

STOP WHEN:
- Pillar prize is awarded
- Spins expire without landing a coin

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing single golds without meeting prize threshold
- Thinking no green dots = can't play (coin resets it)
- Chasing middle reel gold dragons

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/pillars-of-cash-celestial-fortune--festive-fortune-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/pillars-of-cash-celestial-fortune--festive-fortune-2.jpg - Three gold dragons is always a play.

GUIDE 74: PINWHEEL PRIZES
==================================================

Category: multi-state
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
10+ golden wedges in green + blue wheels combined | 15+ golden wedges total (check count on bet pad)

STOP PLAYING:
After golden wedge prize awarded (wedge resets to default) and remaining golden wedges fall below threshold

HOW IT WORKS:
Pinwheel Prizes (Cat & Tiger / Majestic Oasis) features **five pinwheels** with wedges:

**Pinwheel Colors (Left to Right):**
| Color | Reel | Trigger Difficulty |
|-------|------|-------------------|
| Green | 1 | Easiest |
| Blue | 2 | Easy |
| Purple | 3 | Medium |
| Orange | 4 | Hard |
| Red | 5 | Hardest |

**Mechanic:**
- Each pinwheel has 8 wedges (credit prizes or golden wedges with free spins)
- Scatter lands → Increases credit value on wedge, may upgrade to golden
- <strong>3</strong> same-color scatters → Spins that pinwheel, win a wedge
- Wedge won → Resets to default

**Golden Wedges:**
- Always contain <strong>8</strong> free spins (all colors same)
- Transform randomly (not based on credit size)

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — Green + Blue Focus:**
- <strong>10+</strong> golden wedges in green + blue combined
- (Green and blue are easiest to trigger)

**Option B — Total Golden Wedges:**
- <strong>15+</strong> golden wedges anywhere

**How to Check:**
- Look directly on bet pad for golden wedge count
- ⚠️ Number alone doesn't always indicate play—check distribution

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Fewer than <strong>10</strong> golden wedges in green + blue
- Fewer than <strong>15</strong> golden wedges total
- Golden wedges concentrated in purple/orange/red (hard to trigger)

---

STOP WHEN:

- Remaining golden wedges fall below threshold

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing any golden wedges without considering color distribution
- Wasting money on non-+EV states (common hustler mistake)
- Chasing purple/orange/red golden wedges (hard to trigger)
- Relying only on bet pad number without checking colors

---

GUIDE 75: POTS O
==================================================

Category: accumulation
Volatility: medium
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Multipliers in reels 2+3 totaling 10x+ (count plain coins as 1x) | Active wilds in reels 2-3 | Active wilds in reel 4 with multiplier coins (2x or 3x) | VERIFY: background behind coins is ORANGE not green

STOP PLAYING:
After wild reel spins deplete (coins above reel empty)

HOW IT WORKS:
Pots O' Luck features **coin collection for wild reels**:

**Mechanic:**
- Coin holders above reels 2, 3, and 4
- <strong>3</strong> coins collected → Reel turns wild for <strong>3</strong> spins
- Coins can be plain (1x) or multipliers (2x, 3x)

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — Multiplier Setup:**
- Multipliers in reels 2 + 3 totaling <strong>10x+</strong>
- Count plain coins as 1x
- Examples: 3x + 3x + 2x + 2x = 10x ✅

**Option B — Active Wilds (Reels 2-3):**
- Active wilds in reels 2 OR 3
- **VERIFY:** Orange background behind coins

**Option C — Active Wilds (Reel 4):**
- Active wilds in reel 4
- AND multiplier coins (2x or 3x) above reel
- **VERIFY:** Orange background behind coins

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Green background behind coins (NOT active)
- Only plain coins without meeting 10x threshold
- Two coins above reel (extremely common, NOT +EV)

---

STOP WHEN:
- Wild reel spins deplete (coins above reel empty)

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Trusting gold border without checking background color
- Playing 2-coin setups (game is rigged to reach 2 coins quickly)
- Thinking pots of gold display matters (it doesn't)
- Not verifying orange vs green background

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/pots-o-luck-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/pots-o-luck-2.jpg
  Image 3: /images/games/pots-o-luck-3.jpg - The glowing gold borders (and 2x and 3x symbols) stay on the reels when switching between bet levels. This makes the game difficult to hustle.
  Image 4: /images/games/pots-o-luck-4.jpg - The middle reel here looks like it has two wild spins remaining. But look closely and you will notice the background behind the coins is green (rather than orange), so this is not a play.

GUIDE 76: PUB SERIES
==================================================

Category: cycle-based
Volatility: medium
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Full or half-full drink wilds in reels 2 or 3 | 3 or more active drink wilds in reel 4 | On-the-house meter halfway into last segment (ignore empty/near-empty glasses—they leave next spin)

STOP PLAYING:
After all drink wilds empty and disappear from reels

HOW IT WORKS:
The Pub Series features **sticky wilds + on-the-house meter**:

**Game Variants:**
- Anastasia's Tavern
- Isabella's Tequileria
- Kaleigh's Pub
- Sofia's Cellar

**Mechanic:**
- Drink wilds appear in reels 2, 3, and 4
- Wilds stay for <strong>2</strong> additional spins after landing
- "On-the-house" meter triggers free games when full

**Reading the Drinks:**
| Glass Level | Spins Remaining | Action |
|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| Full | <strong>2</strong> spins | ✅ Play |
| Half-full | <strong>1</strong> spin | ✅ Play |
| Empty/near-empty | <strong>0</strong> spins | ❌ Skip (disappears next spin) |

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — Active Wilds (Reels 2-3):**
- Full or half-full drink wilds in reels 2 OR 3

**Option B — Active Wilds (Reel 4):**
- <strong>3</strong> or more active drink wilds in reel 4

**Option C — On-The-House Meter:**
- Meter halfway into last full segment
- Look for red showing in final segment
- Located on bet pad

| Setup | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Active wilds in reel 2 or 3 | ✅ **Play** |
| 3+ active wilds in reel 4 | ✅ **Play** |
| Meter in last segment (red showing) | ✅ **Play** |
| Empty/near-empty glasses only | ❌ Skip |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Glass looks empty or has tiny amount in bottom (disappears next spin)
- Only wilds in reel 4 without meeting 3+ threshold
- Meter not yet in last segment

---

STOP WHEN:
- All drink wilds empty and disappear from reels
- Free games bonus triggers (if playing meter)

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing empty/near-empty glasses (they disappear next spin)
- Not checking glass fill level carefully
- Missing that meter feature doesn't exist on older versions
- Confusing wild appearance with actual spins remaining

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/pub-series-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/pub-series-4.jpg - On Anastasia’s Tavern, the sticky wild at the bottom of reel four will be around for one more spin.
  Image 3: /images/games/pub-series-5.jpg - On Isabella’s Tequileria, the wild in reel three will disappear next spin, while the wild in reel four will last for one more spin.
  Image 4: /images/games/pub-series-6.jpg - This is a solid play on Kaleigh’s Pub—each wild will persist for two additional spins.
  Image 5: /images/games/pub-series-7.jpg - On Sofia’s Cellar, the wilds in reel four will disappear next spin, so don’t play in this situation.

GUIDE 77: RED SILK / AZTEC CHIEF
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Active wilds in first 3 reels only (gold border + 1-2 coins showing spins remaining)

STOP PLAYING:
After wild spins deplete (coin holders above reels empty)

HOW IT WORKS:
Red Silk / Aztec Chief features **coin collection for wild reels**:

**Mechanic:**
- Coin holders above each reel
- <strong>2</strong> coins collected → Reel turns wild for <strong>2</strong> spins
- Active wilds have glowing gold border
- Coins in holder show spins remaining

**Key Difference from Golden Egypt:**
- More payout in progressives/jackpot pick bonus
- Line hits with coins less lucrative
- **Play TIGHTER than Golden Egypt**

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Primary Requirement:**
- Active wilds (gold border + coins showing) in first <strong>3</strong> reels only

**Reel 4 Exception:**
- Active wild in reel 4 with <strong>2</strong> spins remaining
- AND <strong>2+</strong> coins already in first 3 reels
- Play <strong>1</strong> spin only to try for second wild reel
- Stop if no second coin lands

| Setup | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Active wild in reels 1-3 | ✅ **Play** |
| Reel 4 wild (2 spins) + 2 coins in reels 1-3 | ✅ **1 spin test** |
| Coins only (no active wilds) | ❌ Skip |
| Reels 4-5 wilds only | ❌ Skip |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Only coins without active wilds (gold borders)
- Active wilds only in reels 4-5
- Treating this like Golden Egypt (common mistake)

---

STOP WHEN:
- Wild spins deplete (coin holders empty)
- Test spin fails to land second coin (reel 4 exception)

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing like Golden Egypt (coins only, no active wilds)
- Thinking lanterns/masks display matters (it doesn't)
- Playing single coins hoping to trigger wilds
- Not recognizing difference from Golden Egypt

---

  Image 2: /images/games/red-silk--aztec-chief-2.jpg
  Image 3: /images/games/red-silk--aztec-chief-3.jpg - The second reel will be wild for one more spin, while the third reel will be wild for two more spins.
  Image 4: /images/games/red-silk--aztec-chief-4.jpg - This may look +EV with a coin in each of the first four reels, but I would avoid playing in situations like this (and most other experienced APs would agree).
  Image 5: /images/games/red-silk--aztec-chief-5.jpg - This handpay on Aztec Chief was the result of someone leaving behind active wilds in the first four reels.

2 or fewer tiles remaining (check bet pad for count) | 0 tiles in 5th reel (rare but best opportunity)

STOP PLAYING:
After all 20 tiles shattered and bonus triggers

HOW IT WORKS:
Reef of Riches features **tile shattering for bonus trigger**:

**Game Variants:**
- Reef of Riches
- Wild Mermaid

**Mechanic:**
- 5x4 reelset with <strong>20</strong> tiles behind symbols
- Tiles shattered by: line hits, scatter symbols, or pirate character
- All <strong>20</strong> tiles shattered → Bonus triggers

**Tile Difficulty by Position:**
| Reel Position | Difficulty | Reason |
|---------------|------------|--------|
| Reels 1-3 | Easier | Line hits cover first 3 reels frequently |
| Reel 4 | Medium | Less frequent line coverage |
| Reel 5 | Hardest | Rarely hit by line wins |

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — Low Tile Count:**
- <strong>2</strong> or fewer tiles remaining anywhere
- Check bet pad directly for count

**Option B — Fifth Reel Clear:**
- <strong>0</strong> tiles remaining in fifth reel
- Rare but best opportunity (hardest tiles already gone)

| Tiles Remaining | Action |
|-----------------|--------|
| 0-2 anywhere | ✅ **Play** |
| 0 in reel 5 | ✅ **Play** (best case) |
| 3+ tiles | ❌ Skip |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- More than 2 tiles remaining
- Tiles concentrated in reel 5 (frustrating grind)

---

STOP WHEN:
- All 20 tiles shattered and bonus triggers

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing with too many tiles remaining (3+)
- Not checking bet pad for exact count
- Underestimating frustration of final reel 5 tiles
- Expecting consistent bonus payouts

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/reef-of-riches-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/reef-of-riches-2.jpg - The final tile (shown at the top of the fifth reel) can sometimes take a long time to trigger.
  Image 3: /images/games/reef-of-riches-3.jpg - You can look directly on the bet pad to see the number of tiles remaining for each bet level.

GUIDE 79: REEL CLIMB
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
3 or fewer firecrackers total on reels 2+3 combined (count arrows as -1) | Any reel with glowing outline and number above (1 or 2) | Arrow symbol with only 1 firecracker remaining | MAX arrow on any reel

STOP PLAYING:
After all active reel spins complete (counter above reel reaches 0)

HOW IT WORKS:
Reel Climb features **firecrackers that expand reels + activate wild triggers**:

**Game Variants:**
- Celestial Mountain
- Prosperity

**Mechanic:**
- <strong>4</strong> sets of firecrackers above reels 2, 3, and 4
- Arrow symbol lands → One firecracker set explodes, reel expands
- All 4 sets exploded → Reel becomes active for <strong>3</strong> spins
- Dragon on active reel → Entire reel turns wild

**Counting Firecrackers:**
- Arrow on reel = -1 firecracker (explodes next spin)
- Example: 2 firecrackers + arrow = counts as 1

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — Low Firecracker Count:**
- Reels 2 + 3 combined have <strong>3</strong> or fewer firecrackers
- Count arrows as -1
- Examples: 1+1=2 ✅, 1+2=3 ✅, 2+2=4 ❌

**Option B — Active Reels:**
- Any reel with glowing outline and number above (<strong>1</strong> or <strong>2</strong>)

**Option C — Imminent Activation:**
- <strong>1</strong> firecracker remaining + arrow symbol on reel
- Reel will become active next spin

**Option D — MAX Arrow:**
- Any arrow symbol that says "MAX"
- Explodes ALL firecrackers above that reel next spin

| Setup | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Reels 2+3 ≤ 3 firecrackers total | ✅ **Play** |
| Glowing reel with 1 or 2 counter | ✅ **Play** |
| 1 firecracker + arrow on reel | ✅ **Play** |
| MAX arrow anywhere | ✅ **Play** |
| Reels 2+3 > 3 firecrackers | ❌ Skip |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- More than 3 total firecrackers on reels 2+3 combined
- No active reels and no imminent activation
- Only reel 4 progress (less valuable)

---

STOP WHEN:
- All active reel spins complete (counter above reel reaches 0)

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Not counting arrows as -1 firecracker
- Forgetting that active reel ≠ automatic wild (need dragon)
- Playing when reels 2+3 have too many firecrackers
- Missing MAX arrow opportunities

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/reel-climb-celestial-mountain--prosperity-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/reel-climb-celestial-mountain--prosperity-2.jpg - This is a solid play with the first reel with firecrackers (reel two) down to two sets remaining and the second reel with firecrackers (reel three) down to just one set of firecrackers remaining.
  Image 3: /images/games/reel-climb-celestial-mountain--prosperity-3.jpg - The arrow symbols that expand the reels (by exploding the firecrackers) aren’t applied until the next spin. So the first reel with firecrackers (reel two) will be active for the next three spins.
  Image 4: /images/games/reel-climb-celestial-mountain--prosperity-4.jpg - The first reel with firecrackers (reel two) will be active for one more spin (notice the counter above the reel).
  Image 5: /images/games/reel-climb-celestial-mountain--prosperity-5.jpg - You can get huge wins on this game even on small bets. This is a $264.60 line hit (the win amount was still counting up when I snapped the pic) on a $0.60 bet.

GUIDE 80: Regal Link: Lion / Raven
==================================================

Category: must-hit-by
Volatility: low
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Silver 9+ | Amber 47+ | Sapphire 58+ | Amethyst 73+ | Emerald 98+ | Diamond 199+ (if 2 meters are close, play 1 number early on each)

STOP PLAYING:
After free games feature triggers and cash wilds are awarded

HOW IT WORKS:
Regal Link features **cash wilds with MHB meters**:

**Game Variants:**
- Regal Link: Lion
- Regal Link: Raven

**Key Difference from Regal Riches:**
- Wilds accrue MUCH more slowly
- Cash wilds (contain credit prizes) instead of standard wilds
- More volatile bonuses
- **Play TIGHTER than Regal Riches**

**Meter Structure:**
| Meter | Color | Starts At | MHB |
|-------|-------|-----------|-----|
| Silver | Silver | Base game | N/A |
| Amber | Orange | 30 | 50 |
| Sapphire | Blue | 40 | 60 |
| Amethyst | Purple | 50 | 75 |
| Emerald | Green | 75 | 100 |
| Diamond | Yellow | 175 | 200 |

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Single Meter Thresholds:**

| Meter | Play At | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Silver (base game) | <strong>9+</strong> | Most common find |
| Amber (orange) | <strong>47+</strong> | |
| Sapphire (blue) | <strong>58+</strong> | |
| Amethyst (purple) | <strong>73+</strong> | |
| Emerald (green) | <strong>98+</strong> | |
| Diamond (yellow) | <strong>199+</strong> | ⚠️ See warning below |

**Multiple Meter Bonus:**
- If 2 meters are close to playable, play <strong>1</strong> number early on each
- Example: 46 amber + 57 sapphire = ✅ Play

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Meters below thresholds
- Diamond at 197-198 (trap)
- Only one meter slightly below threshold (no combo bonus)

---

STOP WHEN:
- Free games feature triggers and cash wilds are awarded

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing like original Regal Riches (different game)
- Jumping in early on diamond
- Not recognizing cash wilds vs standard wilds
- Missing silver wilds (most common playable find)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/regal-link-lion--raven-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/regal-link-lion--raven-2.jpg - This is a solid play with 10 silver wilds collected (shown directly above the middle reel).
  Image 3: /images/games/regal-link-lion--raven-3.jpg - The credit prizes in the cash wilds are awarded regardless of forming any line hits.
  Image 4: /images/games/regal-link-lion--raven-4.jpg
  Image 5: /images/games/regal-link-lion--raven-5.jpg - The bonuses are much higher variance compared to the original Regal Riches. This emerald paid nearly 200x.
  Image 6: /images/games/regal-link-lion--raven-6.jpg - The bet pad doesn’t show the meters like the original Regal Riches, so this game is more of a hassle to check.

GUIDE 81: REGAL RICHES / PROSPERITY PEARL
==================================================

Category: must-hit-by
Volatility: low
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Blue 8+ or Purple 61+ or Green 84+ or Yellow 112+ | Check bet pad for purple/green/yellow meters, tap bet levels to see blue

STOP PLAYING:
After free games feature triggers and wilds are awarded

HOW IT WORKS:
Regal Riches / Prosperity Pearl features **MHB progressive wilds**:

**Mechanic:**
- Wilds accumulate in meters
- Blue wilds: Base game (counter above middle reel)
- Purple/Green/Yellow wilds: Awarded during free games feature

**Meter Structure:**
| Color | Type | Resets To | MHB | Avg Payout at MHB |
|-------|------|-----------|-----|-------------------|
| Blue | Base game | 5 | 50 | Varies |
| Purple | Minor | 30 | 75 | 75x bet |
| Green | Major | 40 | 100 | 150x bet |
| Yellow | Mega | 50 | 125 | 225x bet |

**Wild Multipliers:**
- Wilds landing on wilds = Multipliers (up to 5x)
- Multiple multipliers on same row = Huge payouts

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Break-Even Thresholds (wait higher for more profit):**

| Progressive | Play At | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| Blue (base game) | <strong>8+</strong> | Most common find |
| Purple (minor) | <strong>61+</strong> | Accumulates fastest |
| Green (major) | <strong>84+</strong> | Accumulates slower |
| Yellow (mega) | <strong>112+</strong> | ⚠️ Large bankroll required |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Blue at 7 (common AP trap - others "sell" 7's to naive players)
- Meters below thresholds
- Yellow without adequate bankroll

---

STOP WHEN:
- Free games feature triggers and wilds are awarded

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing blue 7's (not +EV)
- Chasing yellow without large bankroll
- Not checking blue (requires tapping bet levels)
- Getting excited during "suspense spin" (rarely triggers)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/regal-riches--prosperity-pearl-1.jpg

  Image 3: /images/games/regal-riches--prosperity-pearl-3.jpg
  Image 4: /images/games/regal-riches--prosperity-pearl-4.jpg - This is a great situation to be in, with green at 90, purple at 60 and blue at 22.
  Image 5: /images/games/regal-riches--prosperity-pearl-5.jpg - It’s common to exceed the MHB amount when entering the free games feature—if purple is at 74 and you collect four more purple wilds, then you will go into the feature with 78.
  Image 6: /images/games/regal-riches--prosperity-pearl-6.jpg - Check your BLUES. Someone left this at 20 blues.
  Image 7: /images/games/regal-riches--prosperity-pearl-7.jpg - Walked up on 20 blues, 3 spins later picked up $37.50 on a .75 bet.


==================================================
GUIDE 82: RICH LITTLE PIGGIES
==================================================

Category: must-hit-by
Volatility: low
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Blue pig 24+ free games | 22+ if yellow pig is fat | 20+ if all 3 pigs are fat (3 chins = max/fat pig)

STOP PLAYING:
After triggering any pig feature

HOW IT WORKS:
Rich Little Piggies features **three progressive pigs** that build up over time:

| Pig | Color | Feature |
|-----|-------|---------|
| **Blue Pig** | 🔵 | Increasing free games (caps at 100) |
| **Yellow Pig** | 🟡 | Jackpot prize chances |
| **Red Pig** | 🔴 | Guaranteed wilds (Hog Wild) OR symbol removal (Meal Ticket) |

**Key Mechanic:**
- Pigs get **fatter** as features build up
- 3 chins = **maximum/fat pig**
- Features trigger **randomly** (NOT must-hit-by)
- Fatter pigs are **NOT more likely to hit**

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — Blue Pig Only:**
- Blue pig ≥ <strong>24</strong> free games
- Other pigs: Does not matter

**Option B — Blue + Yellow:**
- Blue pig ≥ <strong>22</strong> free games
- Yellow pig: Fat (3 chins)

**Option C — All Pigs Fat:**
- Blue pig ≥ <strong>20</strong> free games
- Yellow pig: Fat (3 chins)
- Red pig: Fat (3 chins)
- Visual: All 3 pigs squished together

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** These are uncapped progressives. If the setup doesn't clearly match, **do not play**.

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Blue pig below <strong>20</strong> free games
- Only yellow or red pigs are fat (blue must be primary trigger)
- You cannot afford <strong>$1,500+</strong> potential investment
- You are chasing a previous loss on this game
- Feature already partially triggered

---

STOP WHEN:
- Any pig feature triggers
- Bankroll loss exceeds predetermined limit
- Blue pig reaches 50+ without triggering (cut losses)

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Chasing pigs that "look close" (fat pigs are NOT more likely to hit)
- Playing with insufficient bankroll (can easily require $1,500+ investment)
- Expecting blue pig to trigger at 100 (100 is cap, not guaranteed trigger)
- Playing when only yellow/red are fat (blue is the primary value driver)
- Continuing after a single pig triggers without blue

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/rich-little-piggies-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/rich-little-piggies-2.jpg - Look for all three pigs to be this fat and sweaty. If you see 3 chins, that is a max pig size.
  Image 3: /images/games/rich-little-piggies-3.jpg - Triggering the feature with multiple pigs happens fairly frequently. But it is also usually a small payout if you get a pig alone.
  Image 4: /images/games/rich-little-piggies-4.jpg - $22.50 is risky, but at 38 blue this is still tempting. Play if you have $2k bankroll.


==================================================
GUIDE 83: RISING DIAMOND
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
16807 ways (always play) | 7776 ways with 1+ spins remaining | Lower ways with diamonds (expand NEXT spin) | 7776 at 0 spins with 1 diamond | 3125 with 1 diamond | 1024 with 2 diamonds | 243 with 3 diamonds

STOP PLAYING:
After bonus feature triggers at max height (16807 ways)

HOW IT WORKS:
Rising Diamond features **expanding reels with diamond wilds**:

**Mechanic:**
- Diamond symbols land in reels 2, 3, and 4
- Diamond lands → Reels expand one level NEXT spin
- Player gets <strong>3</strong> spins to land more diamonds
- No diamond within 3 spins → Reels drop one level
- Max height triggers bonus feature

**Reel Heights (Ways-to-Win):**
| Level | Ways | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| 1 | 243 | Starting level |
| 2 | 1,024 | |
| 3 | 3,125 | |
| 4 | 7,776 | |
| 5 | 16,807 | Triggers bonus |

**Key Insight:**
- Diamonds expand on NEXT spin, not current spin
- Zero spins remaining + diamond on reel = Still a play

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Always Play:**
- <strong>16,807</strong> ways (always play)

**With Spins Remaining:**
- <strong>7,776</strong> ways with <strong>1+</strong> spins remaining

**With Diamonds Visible (even at 0 spins):**

| Current Ways | Diamonds on Reels | Action |
|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| 7,776 | <strong>1+</strong> | ✅ **Play** |
| 3,125 | <strong>1+</strong> | ✅ **Play** |
| 1,024 | <strong>2+</strong> | ✅ **Play** |
| 243 | <strong>3</strong> | ✅ **Play** (rare) |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- 7,776 ways with 0 spins and no diamonds visible
- Lower ways without enough diamonds to compensate
- Below playable thresholds

---

STOP WHEN:
- Bonus feature triggers at max height (16,807 ways)

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Not knowing diamonds expand on NEXT spin
- Ignoring machines at 0 spins with diamonds visible
- Not counting diamonds on reels at lower way levels
- Forgetting reels only drop ONE level (not reset)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/rising-diamond-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/rising-diamond-2.jpg
  Image 3: /images/games/rising-diamond-3.jpg
  Image 4: /images/games/rising-diamond-4.jpg - This is also a play, even with the ways at 1024 and zero spins remaining. The two diamond symbols will expand the reels two levels on the next spin, all the way to 7776.
  Image 5: /images/games/rising-diamond-5.jpg - The bonus feature is fairly volatile, but it can lead to nice wins, especially with multiple retriggers (which are easy to get).


==================================================
GUIDE 84: Rising Phoenix
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
3 flames + 24x total multipliers | 2 flames + 36x | 1 flame + 48x | 0 flames + 60x | Check bet pad for flame count and add all wedge multipliers (yellow wedges = 5x or higher)

STOP PLAYING:
After flame meter fills and wheel spins (triggered wedge resets to 2x)

HOW IT WORKS:
Rising Phoenix features a **multiplier wheel** with flame meter:

**Mechanic:**
- Phoenix lands → Reel turns wild, fills 1 flame spot
- <strong>4</strong> flames filled + line hit → Wheel spins, multiplier applied
- No line hit at 4 flames → Up to 3 wedges increase by 1x
- After 4th flame fills → Meter clears (line hit or not)

**Wedge Values:**
- Start at <strong>2x</strong>
- Flames appear at <strong>5x+</strong>
- Max value: <strong>20x</strong> (rare)
- After triggered: Resets to <strong>2x</strong>

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Check bet pad for flame count, then add all wedge multipliers:**

| Flames | Required Total Multipliers |
|--------|---------------------------|
| 3 | ≥ <strong>24x</strong> (or 2+ wedges on fire) |
| 2 | ≥ <strong>36x</strong> |
| 1 | ≥ <strong>48x</strong> |
| 0 | ≥ <strong>60x</strong> |

**Wedge on Fire = 5x or higher (yellow flames visible)**

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Multiplier totals below thresholds above
- Only looking at flames without checking multipliers

---

STOP WHEN:
- Flame meter fills and wheel spins
- Triggered wedge resets to <strong>2x</strong>
- Remaining multipliers fall below threshold

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Only playing 3 flames without checking multipliers
- Missing plays with 2/1/0 flames but high multipliers
- Expecting 3-of-a-kind to pay well (need 5-of-a-kind)
- Not recognizing flaming wedges (5x+)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/rising-phoenix-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/rising-phoenix-2.jpg
  Image 3: /images/games/rising-phoenix-3.jpg - The total multipliers on the wheel add up to 47x here, so this is a play even with two flames collected.
  Image 4: /images/games/rising-phoenix-4.jpg - You can look directly on the bet pad to see the flames collected for each bet level.


==================================================
GUIDE 85: River Dragons & Fire Wolf 2 Series (Forest/Winter Dragons, Wolf Queen)
==================================================

Category: must-hit-by
Volatility: low
Min Bet: $30

LOOK FOR:
$500 MHB at $486+ or $5,000 MHB at $4,920+ | Also applies to Fire Wolf 2, Forest Dragons, Winter Dragons, Wolf Queen

STOP PLAYING:
After MHB jackpot hits and resets

HOW IT WORKS:
River Dragons series features **two MHB progressive jackpots**:

**Game Variants:**
- River Dragons
- Fire Wolf 2
- Forest Dragons
- Winter of the Dragons
- Wolf Queen

**Progressive Structure:**
| Jackpot | MHB | Resets To |
|---------|-----|-----------|
| $500 | $500 | $200 |
| $5,000 | $5,000 | $2,000 or $4,000 |

**Jackpot Weighting:**
- Weighted to hit at the VERY TOP
- Realistic chance starts at $490 / $4,990
- Always assume they will go to the end

---

PLAY WHEN:
| Progressive | Play At | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| $500 MHB | <strong>$486+</strong> | Conservative threshold |
| $5,000 MHB | <strong>$4,920+</strong> | Conservative threshold |

**Note:** These thresholds account for lower RTP settings. Wait higher for more profit.

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Below threshold amounts
- Without adequate bankroll
- "Xtreme Jackpots" variants (no MHB)
- Max betting without understanding variance

---

STOP WHEN:
- MHB jackpot hits and resets

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Max betting (increases variance dramatically)
- Taking play too early ($480 / $4,900)
- Not having adequate bankroll
- Expecting early hits (rare)
- Missing tax implications on $5,000

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/river-dragons-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/river-dragons-2.jpg - Neither of these numbers are even close to playable.
  Image 3: /images/games/river-dragons-3.jpg - The MHB $5k is still far away from a profitable number, but I wouldn’t be surprised if another AP jumps on this soon just to build up their player’s card.
  Image 4: /images/games/river-dragons-4.jpg - River Dragons can be fairly volatile—the amount of profit you make often comes down to how many good bonuses like this that you hit.
  Image 5: /images/games/river-dragons-5.jpg - Fire Wolf 2 plays just like River Dragons.


==================================================
GUIDE 86: Samurai Dynasty
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
1 bonus symbol in top row | 2 bonus symbols in middle row | Avoid if 3 bonus symbols visible (bonus just triggered, symbols disappear next spin)

STOP PLAYING:
After free games bonus triggers

HOW IT WORKS:
Samurai Dynasty features **persistent bonus symbols that move down**:

**Mechanic:**
- Bonus symbols move down one row each spin
- <strong>3</strong> bonus symbols anywhere → Free games bonus triggers
- Symbols persist until they exit bottom of reels

**Row Positions (3 rows):**
| Row | Position |
|-----|----------|
| Top | Just landed (3 spins to exit) |
| Middle | 2 spins to exit |
| Bottom | 1 spin to exit |

---

PLAY WHEN:
| Setup | Action |
|-------|--------|
| <strong>1</strong> bonus symbol in TOP row | ✅ **Play** |
| <strong>2</strong> bonus symbols in MIDDLE row | ✅ **Play** |
| <strong>3</strong> bonus symbols visible | ❌ **NEVER** (trap) |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- 3 bonus symbols visible (bonus just triggered)
- Only symbols in bottom row (about to exit)
- Symbols too spread out to realistically trigger

---

STOP WHEN:
- Free games bonus triggers

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing when 3 symbols are visible (they disappear)
- Not checking symbol row positions
- Expecting consistent bonus payouts (feast or famine)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/samurai-dynasty-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/samurai-dynasty-2.jpg - The bonus symbols (shown in reels one and two) move down one position every spin.
  Image 3: /images/games/samurai-dynasty-3.jpg - If you see three bonus symbols, that means the bonus was just triggered and that the symbols will disappear next spin.
  Image 4: /images/games/samurai-dynasty-4.jpg - Most of your bonuses will be a disappointment.
  Image 5: /images/games/samurai-dynasty-5.jpg - Expect the occasional large bonus like this when the wild phoenix symbols lock in place.

GUIDE 87: SCARAB / DIAMOND MANIA
==================================================

Category: accumulation
Volatility: medium
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Game 9: 1+ frames in first 3 reels | Game 7-8: 2+ frames same row in first 3 reels | Game 5-6: 3+ frames same row in first 4 reels | Game 3-4: 4+ frames in first 3 reels | 3+ same row in first 4 | Game 1-2: 5+ frames in first 3 reels | 3+ same row in first 4 | Never play game 10 (wilds activate this spin)

STOP PLAYING:
After spin 10 completes (frames turn wild and board resets)

HOW IT WORKS:
Scarab / Diamond Mania operates on a **10-game cycle with locking frames**:

**Game Variants:**
- Legend of the 3X 2X Phoenix / Triple Double Diamond Scarab
- Diamond Mania (clone)

**Mechanic:**
- Frames lock during <strong>10</strong> game cycle
- Spin 10: ALL locked frames turn wild
- Board resets after spin 10

**Why Mid-Cycle is Valuable:**
- Payout based on full 10-game cycle average
- Starting mid-cycle = Same return potential, half the cost
- Fewer frames needed later in cycle

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Simplified Rule:**
- Lots of frames on the LEFT (reels 1-3)
- Preferably connected HORIZONTALLY (for 4-of-a-kind or 5-of-a-kind)
- Further in cycle = Better

**Detailed Thresholds:**

| Spin | Frames Needed | Location |
|------|---------------|----------|
| 10 of 10 | ❌ **NEVER** | N/A |
| 9 of 10 | <strong>1+</strong> | First 3 reels |
| 8-7 of 10 | <strong>2+</strong> same row | First 3 reels |
| 6-5 of 10 | <strong>3+</strong> same row | First 4 reels |
| 4-3 of 10 | <strong>4+</strong> OR <strong>3+</strong> same row | First 3 reels OR first 4 (same row) |
| 2-1 of 10 | <strong>5+</strong> OR <strong>3+</strong> same row | First 3 reels OR first 4 (same row) |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Spin 10 of 10 (wilds activate THIS spin, too late)
- Frames not connected horizontally (early in cycle)
- Fewer frames than threshold for spin position

---

STOP WHEN:
- Spin 10 completes (frames turn wild, board resets)

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing spin 10 of 10 (no value left)
- Focusing on 3-of-a-kind setups (pays poorly)
- Not prioritizing horizontal connections
- Playing early cycle with scattered frames

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/scarab--diamond-mania-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/scarab--diamond-mania-2.jpg
  Image 3: /images/games/scarab--diamond-mania-3.jpg - Five-of-a-kind wilds pay very well.
  Image 4: /images/games/scarab--diamond-mania-4.jpg
  Image 5: /images/games/scarab--diamond-mania-5.jpg
  Image 6: /images/games/scarab--diamond-mania-6.jpg - If you play Scarab and Diamond Mania enough, you will eventually stumble upon plays like this, inexplicably abandoned on the ninth spin right before a huge payout.
  Image 7: /images/games/scarab--diamond-mania-7.jpg - With enough wilds, the game can pay very well, even on the lower bet levels.

LOOK FOR:
Locked frames concentrated in first 3 reels, preferably aligned horizontally | Game 9: 2+ frames | Games 7-8: 3+ frames same row | Games 5-6: 5+ frames (or 3+ same row in first 4 reels) | Games 1-4: 6-7+ frames (or 4+ same row)

STOP PLAYING:
After spin 10 completes (all frames turn wild, then board resets)

HOW IT WORKS:
Scarab Grand operates on a **10-game cycle** with frame collection:

**Mechanic:**
- Locked frames accumulate through 10-game cycle
- Spin 10 → All accumulated frames turn WILD
- Full board of frames = <strong>1000x</strong> bet payout
- Taller reelset than original Scarab (+2 rows)

**Goal:** Frames in first 3 reels, aligned horizontally for 4/5-of-a-kind

---

PLAY WHEN:
N/A

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Game <strong>10</strong> of 10 (NEVER)
- Frames not aligned horizontally (late in cycle)
- Only 3-of-a-kind possible (pays poorly)

---

STOP WHEN:
- Spin 10 completes
- All frames turn wild
- Board resets

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing game 10 of 10
- Expecting 3-of-a-kind to pay well (aim for 4+ of a kind)
- Not prioritizing horizontal alignment late in cycle

GUIDE 89: Sphinx 4D
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Wild spheres in reels 2-3 not on bottom row (most valuable) | Wild spheres in reels 1 or 4 in top 2 rows only

STOP PLAYING:
After wild sphere moves off bottom row or triggers expansion on lion/lioness symbol

HOW IT WORKS:
Sphinx 4D features **wild spheres** that move down (unlike Ocean Magic which moves up):

**Mechanic:**
- Wild spheres move **down one row** every spin
- Sphere lands on lion/lioness symbol → All surrounding symbols turn wild
- Expansion: 3 spaces above, 3 below, 1 each side (if room)

**Modes:**
| Mode | Trigger Symbol | Visual |
|------|----------------|--------|
| Day | Yellow lion | Day background |
| Night | Blue lioness | Night background |

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Reels 2-3 (Most Valuable):**
- Wild sphere NOT on bottom row

**Reels 1 and 4:**
- Wild sphere in **top two rows only**

| Reel | Position | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| 2-3 | Top row | ✅ **Play** |
| 2-3 | Middle row | ✅ **Play** |
| 2-3 | Bottom row | ❌ Skip |
| 1 or 4 | Top row | ✅ **Play** |
| 1 or 4 | 2nd from top | ✅ **Play** |
| 1 or 4 | Lower rows | ❌ Skip |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Wild spheres on bottom row (exit next spin)
- Wild spheres in reels 1/4 below top two rows
- Spheres only in positions without room to expand

---

STOP WHEN:
- Wild sphere moves off bottom row
- Sphere triggers expansion on lion/lioness
- No spheres remain in playable positions

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Thinking spheres move UP (they move DOWN—opposite of Ocean Magic)
- Playing bottom row spheres (exit next spin)
- Playing reels 1/4 below top two rows (not enough expansion room)
- Thinking 4D gimmicks offer advantage (they don't)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/sphinx-4d-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/sphinx-4d-2.jpg - This is an excellent play with a wild sphere at the top of the middle reel.
  Image 3: /images/games/sphinx-4d-3.jpg - The wild sphere landed on top of the lion symbol which caused it to expand for a nice win.
  Image 4: /images/games/sphinx-4d-4.jpg - I recommend stopping playing when the wild spheres in reels one and four reach the second row from the bottom because there isn’t as much room for the spheres to fully expand.
  Image 5: /images/games/sphinx-4d-5.jpg - This is not a play because the wild spheres will move down and off screen next spin.

GUIDE 90: SUMO KITTY / LUCHA KITTY
==================================================

Category: accumulation
Volatility: medium
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
6+ connected gold frames without credit values inside (empty frames only)

STOP PLAYING:
After coin lands in connected frames and credit value is awarded (frames disappear next spin)

HOW IT WORKS:
Sumo Kitty / Lucha Kitty features **persistent gold frames with credit multiplication**:

**Game Variants:**
- Sumo Kitty
- Lucha Kitty

**Mechanic:**
- Gold frames lock in place and persist
- Coin lands in frame → Credit amount transfers to ALL connected frames
- Total of all connected frames awarded to player
- Frames disappear next spin after payout

**Credit Prize Range:**
- Low: ~1/3 of bet size
- High: Mini or minor jackpot

---

PLAY WHEN:
| Setup | Action |
|-------|--------|
| <strong>6+</strong> connected gold frames (empty) | ✅ **Play** |
| Frames already contain credit values | ❌ Skip (already triggered) |

**Note:** Location doesn't matter - frames can be anywhere as long as connected.

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Fewer than 6 connected frames
- Frames already contain credit values (will disappear)
- Frames not connected to each other

---

STOP WHEN:
- Coin lands in connected frames and credit value is awarded
- Frames disappear next spin

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing frames that already have credit values inside
- Not counting connected frames accurately
- Expecting consistent payouts (very volatile)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/sumo-kitty--lucha-kitty-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/sumo-kitty--lucha-kitty-2.jpg - A $390 win on a $1.80 bet. This would have been a $7.80 win if a 60 credit coin had landed instead of a 3000 credit coin. So expect a lot of losses with the occasional big win.

Min Bet: $26

LOOK FOR:
2-Minute Drill active (red timer) + 1+ prizes in any of the 4 spots above reels | Check all bet levels (prizes stored separately)

STOP PLAYING:
After filling all 4 spots (prizes awarded) | After any spin lands with no prize (board clears)

HOW IT WORKS:
Super Bowl Jackpots features **2-Minute Drill with persistent prizes**:

**Mechanic:**
- 2-Minute Drill activates bank-wide every <strong>22-26</strong> minutes
- Red timer counts down from 2 minutes
- Credit prizes land → Added to <strong>4</strong> spots above reels
- Fill all 4 spots consecutively → Win all collected prizes
- Any spin with no prize → Board clears

**Key Insight:**
- The 2-Minute Drill itself is NOT +EV
- Collected prizes PERSIST after feature ends
- Prizes remaining = +EV opportunity

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Simple Rule:**
- 2-Minute Drill active (red timer) AND
- <strong>1+</strong> prizes collected in any of the 4 spots

| Spots Filled | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| 1+ prizes | ✅ **Play** |
| 0 prizes | ❌ Skip |

**Variance Reduction:**
- Avoid plays where total collected < bet size

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- No prizes collected in any spot
- 2-Minute Drill not active
- Entire drill from start (not +EV)

---

STOP WHEN:
- All 4 spots filled (prizes awarded)
- Any spin lands with no prize (board clears)

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Fast-spinning through entire 2-Minute Drill
- Not checking all bet levels (prizes stored separately)
- Thinking the drill itself is +EV
- Not setting phone reminders for next activation

---

  Image 2: /images/games/super-bowl-jackpots-2.jpg
  Image 3: /images/games/super-bowl-jackpots-3.jpg - The jackpots can get added to the credit prizes. The minor is $100, so the total equity on the board is $212.50.
  Image 4: /images/games/super-bowl-jackpots-4.jpg - This play resulted in a profit of $113 in two spins.
  Image 5: /images/games/super-bowl-jackpots-5.jpg - This was a walk-up play with $171 of equity on the board.
  Image 6: /images/games/super-bowl-jackpots-6.jpg - It resulted in a $190 profit in one spin. You can make excellent money on this machine in a short amount of time.
  Image 7: /images/games/super-bowl-jackpots-7.jpg - You may want to avoid plays like these with small credit prizes (relative to the bet size) in order to lower your variance and increase your edge.

GUIDE 92: Thor’s Thunder
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Storm Mode active (red text on bet pad for that bet level +

STOP PLAYING:
After Storm Mode ends (lasts up to 10 spins, ends randomly)

HOW IT WORKS:
Thor's Thunder features **Storm Mode with enhanced Thor symbol odds**:

**Normal Mechanic:**
- Thor symbol in center → Awards all prizes on other reel positions
- Hyper Spin feature triggers randomly (many credit prizes land)
- Storm symbol + Thor in center → Triggers Storm Mode

**Storm Mode (The +EV State):**
- Hyper Spin triggers more frequently
- Thor symbol is <strong>70%</strong> more likely to land
- Lasts up to <strong>10</strong> spins (ends randomly)

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Simple Check:**
- Storm Mode active
- Look for: "Storm Mode" displayed above reels
- Look for: Red highlighted text on bet pad for that bet level

| Indicator | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Red text on bet pad + "Storm Mode" above reels | ✅ **Play** |
| Normal text on bet pad | ❌ Skip |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Not in Storm Mode
- Red text not visible on bet pad

---

STOP WHEN:
- Storm Mode ends (happens randomly, no way to predict)

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Not checking all denominations (tap 2¢ and 5¢ buttons)
- Missing the red text indicator on bet pad
- Continuing after Storm Mode ends

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/thors-thunder-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/thors-thunder-2.jpg - The game is currently in Storm Mode. Whenever the Thor symbol lands in the center position, all of the credit prizes are awarded.
  Image 3: /images/games/thors-thunder-3.jpg - The quickest way to check this game is to just glance at the bet pad. The 225 credits bet is currently in Storm Mode.

GUIDE 93: TIAN CI JIN LU
==================================================

Category: must-hit-by
Volatility: low
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Middle progressive at $292+ out of $300 (meter above large coin at top) | Only this meter is MHB - ignore grand/major/minor/mini

STOP PLAYING:
After MHB jackpot hits

HOW IT WORKS:
Tian Ci Jin Lu features **a $300 MHB progressive**:

**Game Variants:**
- Tian Ci Jin Lu: Emperor
- Tian Ci Jin Lu: Phoenix

**Progressive Structure:**
| Jackpot | MHB | Resets To |
|---------|-----|-----------|
| Middle meter | $300 | $100 |

**Meter Increment:**
- Does NOT increment at fixed rate per spin
- Based on coin symbol amounts landed
- Slow and inconsistent progression

---

PLAY WHEN:
| Progressive | Play At |
|-------------|---------|
| Middle meter (above large coin) | <strong>$292+</strong> |

**Location:** Look at the progressive in the MIDDLE of the screen (above the large coin at top)

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Middle meter below $292
- Grand/Major/Minor/Mini jackpots high (not MHB)
- Coin stacks displayed on background (decoration only)

---

STOP WHEN:
- MHB jackpot hits

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Watching wrong jackpot (only middle meter is MHB)
- Thinking coin stacks on background matter (they don't)
- Not understanding the meter increments inconsistently

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/tian-ci-jin-lu-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/tian-ci-jin-lu-2.jpg - The jackpot to pay attention to is the $246.08 one at the top of the screen in the middle (this particular number is way too low to be playable).

GUIDE 94: Tic Tac Go
==================================================

Category: must-hit-by
Volatility: low
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Total X+O values 27x+ bet (add ALL prizes on board) | Avoid full boards or 3-in-a-row (resets next spin) | Consider blocked colors when evaluating prize distribution | Rocket Rollup version: use bet pad amount, not main screen

STOP PLAYING:
After tic-tac-toe game won (3 in a row or draw) and board resets

HOW IT WORKS:
Tic Tac Go features **a tic-tac-toe board with accumulated prizes**:

**Mechanic:**
- 3x3 reelset with 3x3 tic-tac-toe board above
- Red X's and blue O's land on reels → Move to board
- X's/O's contain prizes (1x-10x bet) or jackpots
- 3 in a row → Win ALL prizes of that color (not just the row)
- Draw → Color with most symbols wins

**Prize Range:**
- Credit prizes: 1x to 10x bet size
- Jackpots: Minor, Major, Mega

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Primary Requirement:**
- Total X + O values ≥ <strong>27x</strong> bet size
- Add ALL prizes on the board

**Rocket Rollup Version:**
- Use bet pad amount (NOT main screen)
- Main screen includes progressive contribution
- Example: $0.75 bet pad → Entry point = $20.25 (27x)

| Setup | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Total board value ≥ 27x bet | ✅ **Play** |
| Full board (9 filled) | ❌ Skip (resets next spin) |
| 3 in a row showing | ❌ Skip (resets next spin) |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Full board (all 9 positions filled) - resets next spin
- 3 in a row already showing - resets next spin
- Total value below 27x threshold
- Large values concentrated on blocked/losing color

---

STOP WHEN:
- Tic-tac-toe game won (3 in a row or draw)
- Board resets next spin

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing nearly-full boards (seems good, usually loses)
- Not adding ALL values (both X's and O's)
- Playing when 3 in a row already exists (will reset)
- Using main screen bet amount on Rocket Rollup version
- Ignoring blocked color situations

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/tic-tac-go-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/tic-tac-go-2.jpg - A red X landed in reel three, which won the game for red on the board above. The total value on all of the X’s was awarded.
  Image 3: /images/games/tic-tac-go-3.jpg - Do not play boards like this. Red won on the previous game and the entire board will clear out next spin.
  Image 4: /images/games/tic-tac-go-4.jpg
  Image 5: /images/games/tic-tac-go-5.jpg - This is a much better play because the total equity here is 28x.
  Image 6: /images/games/tic-tac-go-6.jpg - This is an excellent play with both the major and minor jackpots on the board.

GUIDE 95: Top Up Fortunes: Flame / Ocean
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
8+ yellow squares total (tap Paytable on bet pad if not showing) | 6+ yellow squares in first 3 reels | 3 vertical squares above any reel (Add Wild opportunity) | Only count squares with spins remaining (green counter) | 3 vertical at 0 spins counts as 2

STOP PLAYING:
After free games or hold & spin bonus triggers

HOW IT WORKS:
Top Up Fortunes features **expanding reels with Add Wild opportunity**:

**Game Variants:**
- Top Up Fortunes: Flame (volcano symbols)
- Top Up Fortunes: Ocean (trident symbols)

**Mechanic:**
- Volcano/trident lands → Reel expands one level
- Reels: 3 symbols tall → max 6 symbols tall
- Green counter shows spins remaining at current height
- After 3 spins → Reel drops one level

**Add Wild Feature (Key Hidden Value):**
- Land volcano/trident on MAX height reel
- Adds 2+ wilds to reels 2-5
- Can result in massive line hits
- Resets spin counter back to 3

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Reading Yellow Squares:**
- Bet pad shows yellow squares = expanded positions
- 3 vertical squares = 6-symbol tall reel (max)
- Tap "Paytable" on bet pad if not showing
- **CRITICAL:** Only count squares with spins remaining
- 3 vertical at 0 spins = counts as 2

**Entry Points:**

| Setup | Action |
|-------|--------|
| <strong>8+</strong> yellow squares total | ✅ **Play** |
| <strong>6+</strong> yellow squares in first 3 reels | ✅ **Play** |
| <strong>3</strong> vertical squares above any reel | ✅ **Play** (Add Wild opportunity) |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Fewer than 8 total squares (without concentrated setups)
- Squares at 0 spins without accounting for drop
- No Add Wild opportunities visible

---

STOP WHEN:
- Free games bonus triggers
- Hold & spin feature triggers

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Not knowing about Add Wild feature
- Counting squares at 0 spins as full value
- Not tapping Paytable to see yellow squares
- Missing 3-vertical setups (low cost, huge upside)

  Image 4: /images/games/top-up-fortunes-flame--ocean-4.jpg - Landing a volcano symbol in the fifth reel (which was already max height) triggered the Add Wild feature. Sega Sammy games are known for having massive line hits like this.
  Image 5: /images/games/top-up-fortunes-flame--ocean-5.jpg - The yellow squares represent the expanded reels (you may need to tap the Paytable button on the left if you aren’t seeing this screen displayed).

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
BLACK background (not green/blue) with any of: 1+ wild/panda/pirate symbol in reels 1-3 | Wild symbol in BOTH reels 4 and 5 | 400+ ways displayed | Treasure chest 1 space from key

STOP PLAYING:
When background turns green (Panda

HOW IT WORKS:
Treasure features **persistent wilds with background state indicator**:

**Game Variants:**
- Panda's Treasure (rocket symbols, green background when reset)
- Pirate's Treasure (cannon symbols, blue background when reset)

**Mechanic:**
- Rocket/cannon lands → Reel expands one symbol
- Panda/pirate symbols → Turn into persistent wilds next spin
- Treasure chests pushed toward keys → Win credit prize
- Ways: 243 → up to 7,776

**CRITICAL - Background Color:**
| Background | State |
|------------|-------|
| **BLACK** | ✅ State persists next spin |
| **GREEN** (Panda's) | ❌ Resets next spin |
| **BLUE** (Pirate's) | ❌ Resets next spin |

---

PLAY WHEN:
**REQUIRED:** Background must be BLACK

**Plus ANY of the following:**

| Setup | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 1+ wild/panda/pirate in reels 1-3 | ✅ **Play** |
| Wild in BOTH reels 4 AND 5 | ✅ **Play** |
| 400+ ways displayed | ✅ **Play** |
| Treasure chest 1 space from key | ✅ **Play** |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Background is GREEN (Panda's) or BLUE (Pirate's) - RESETS
- No wilds/panda/pirate symbols visible
- Below 400 ways without meeting other criteria

---

STOP WHEN:
- Background turns green (Panda's) or blue (Pirate's)
- State resets next spin

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing when background is green/blue (everything resets)
- Focusing on treasure chests instead of wilds
- Writing off the game as an AP trap
- Missing frequent black background opportunities

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/treasure-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/treasure-3.jpg
  Image 3: /images/games/treasure-4.jpg - Spin 1 of 3: The panda symbol counts as a wild on the spin it lands and will stay as a persistent wild on the next spin (along with the other red wild symbols).
  Image 4: /images/games/treasure-5.jpg
  Image 5: /images/games/treasure-6.jpg
  Image 6: /images/games/treasure-7.jpg - Spin 1 of 5: The pirate symbols will turn into persistent wild symbols on the next spin.
  Image 7: /images/games/treasure-8.jpg - Spin 2 of 5: A cannon symbol landed in the first reel to keep the streak going.
  Image 8: /images/games/treasure-9.jpg - Spin 3 of 5: A pirate symbol landed to continue the streak.
  Image 9: /images/games/treasure-10.jpg - Spin 4 of 5: Another cannon symbol landed to continue the streak. Having taller reels like this gives you more chances to land subsequent symbols to keep the play alive.
  Image 10: /images/games/treasure-11.jpg - Spin 5 of 5: No more cannon or pirate symbols landed, so the play is now dead (notice the blue background). I made a profit of $1,602 on this play (without a W-2G).

HOW IT WORKS:
Ultra Rush Gold X features **gold scatter accumulation for bonus trigger**:

**Game Variants:**
- Ultra Rush Gold X: Bingwen
- Ultra Rush Gold X: Wei Yi

**Mechanic:**
- <strong>5</strong> scatter symbols → Bonus triggers
- Gold scatter lands → Locks for <strong>3</strong> additional spins

**Key Difference from Original:**
- "X" version: 5 scatters needed (not 6)

---

PLAY WHEN:
| Setup | Action |
|-------|--------|

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/ultra-rush-gold-x-bingwen--wei-yi-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/ultra-rush-gold-x-bingwen--wei-yi-2.jpg - The game comes in four denominations, so there are plenty of opportunities to look for plays.
  Image 3: /images/games/ultra-rush-gold-x-bingwen--wei-yi-3.jpg - You can look directly on the bet pad to see any collected gold scatter symbols for all of the bet levels. This is an excellent play with three already collected on the $0.75 bet.

==================================================

Category: accumulation

Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
2 or more gold scatters locked (check bet pad) | 1 gold scatter if wheel symbol or 20x+ credit value | Blue bubbles also count toward the 6 scatters needed

|------|-----------|-------|
| Gold credit | ✅ Locks 3 spins | Credit amount |
| Gold wheel | ✅ Locks 3 spins | Wheel spin in bonus (valuable) |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:

- Gold scatter lock about to expire (0 spins left)
- Just triggered bonus

---

STOP WHEN:
- Hold & Spin bonus triggers (<strong>6</strong> total scatters)

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Thinking you need 6 gold scatters (only need 6 total, blue counts)
- Ignoring wheel symbol gold scatters (more valuable than credit)
- Not checking all denominations via bet pad buttons
- Playing single small credit gold scatter

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/ultra-rush-gold-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/ultra-rush-gold-3.jpg - The gold wheel scatter symbol (shown in the middle reel) awards the player a wheel spin in the bonus, so it is more valuable than the credit value gold scatter symbols (shown in reels four and five).
  Image 3: /images/games/ultra-rush-gold-4.jpg - These two $50 gold scatter symbols are exceptionally large for a $1 bet.
  Image 4: /images/games/ultra-rush-gold-5.jpg - The bonus usually pays very well, especially if you can land a wheel spin.

STOP PLAYING:
After Collect symbol triggers and prizes are awarded

HOW IT WORKS:
WOF 4D Collector's Edition features **credit prizes with Collect trigger**:

**Mechanic:**
- Credit prize above each reel

| 5 | Hardest | 0.33 |

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Simple Method:**
- Total prizes above all 5 reels ≥ <strong>70x</strong> bet
- Prefer values spread across reels (not concentrated)
- Best: Values in reels 2 and 4 (easiest to trigger)
- Worst: Values mostly in reel 5 (avoid)

**Advanced Method (More Accurate):**
- Multiply each reel's value by its weight:
  - Reel 1 × 0.7
  - Reel 2 × 0.9
  - Reel 3 × 0.5
  - Reel 4 × 1.0
  - Reel 5 × 0.33
- Weighted total ≥ <strong>45x</strong> bet

| Method | Threshold |
|--------|-----------|
| Simple (total prizes) | <strong>70x</strong> bet |
| Advanced (weighted) | <strong>45x</strong> bet |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Total below 70x (simple) or 45x weighted (advanced)
- Majority of equity concentrated in reel 5
- Values not spread across reels

---

STOP WHEN:
- Collect symbol triggers and prizes are awarded

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Not accounting for reel difficulty differences
- Playing when equity concentrated in reel 5
- Not spreading value across reels 2 and 4

---

  Image 1: /images/games/wheel-of-fortune-4d-collectors-edition-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/wheel-of-fortune-4d-collectors-edition-2.jpg - This is a solid play with the total prizes equal to 70x the bet level (or 50x when you use the weighted values method).

GUIDE 101: WHEEL OF FORTUNE 4D
==================================================

Category: cycle-based
Volatility: medium
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
3+ yellow multipliers (6x or higher) totaling 24x+ | Any yellow multiplier up next (border directly to the left)

STOP PLAYING:
After triggering one yellow multiplier

HOW IT WORKS:
Wheel of Fortune 4D More Money features **cycling multipliers above reels**:

**Mechanic:**
- Multiplier above each reel (1x to 20x)
- Wild lands → Multiplier above that reel increases by 1x
- Active multiplier has border around it
- Border slides RIGHT one space each spin
- After reel 5 → Cycles back to reel 1
- After triggering → Resets to 1x next spin

**Multiplier Colors:**
| Value | Color |
|-------|-------|
| 1x-5x | Normal |
| 6x+ | **YELLOW** |

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — Multiple Yellow Multipliers:**
- <strong>3+</strong> yellow multipliers (6x or higher)
- Total adds up to <strong>24x+</strong>
- Examples: 8x+8x+8x=24x ✅, 6x+6x+12x=24x ✅

**Option B — Yellow Up Next:**
- Any yellow multiplier has border directly to the left
- Play <strong>1</strong> spin only

| Setup | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 3+ yellow totaling 24x+ | ✅ **Play** |
| Yellow up next (border to left) | ✅ **1 spin** |
| Single yellow, not up next | ❌ Skip |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Single yellow multiplier (even large ones)
- Takes 5 spins to cycle back - not worth the cost
- Multiplier just triggered (will reset)

---

STOP WHEN:
- After triggering one yellow multiplier

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Chasing single yellow multipliers (too many spins to cycle)
- Not checking if last play was a win (multiplier will reset)
- Playing after triggering (stop after one)

---

  Image 3: /images/games/wheel-of-fortune-4d-3.jpg
  Image 4: /images/games/wheel-of-fortune-4d-4.jpg - The 13x yellow multiplier is up next, so I would give this one spin and then stop playing.

GUIDE 102: Wheel of Fortune Wild Spin
==================================================

Category: accumulation
Volatility: medium
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Game 9: 1+ frame in first 3 reels | Game 8-7: 2+ frames in same row (first 3 reels) | Game 6-5: 3+ frames in same row (first 4 reels) | Game 4-3: 5+ frames in first 3 reels | 4 frames in same row | Game 2-1: 6+ frames in first 3 reels | 4 frames in same row | Never play Game 10

STOP PLAYING:
After spin 10 completes (all frames turn wild, board resets)

HOW IT WORKS:
Wheel of Fortune Wild Spin operates on a **10-game cycle with locking frames**:

**Game Variants:**
- Vacation
- Night Life

**Mechanic:**
- Frames lock during <strong>10</strong> game cycle
- Spin 10: ALL locked frames turn wild
- Board resets after spin 10

**Key Difference from Scarab:**
- More payout in wheel bonus and progressives
- Line hits with wilds slightly less lucrative
- Wheel bonus can act as line hit blocker

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Simplified Rule:**
- Lots of frames on the LEFT (reels 1-3)
- Preferably connected HORIZONTALLY
- Further in cycle = Better

**Detailed Thresholds:**

| Spin | Frames Needed | Location |
|------|---------------|----------|
| 10 of 10 | ❌ **NEVER** | N/A |
| 9 of 10 | <strong>1+</strong> | First 3 reels |
| 8-7 of 10 | <strong>2+</strong> same row | First 3 reels |
| 6-5 of 10 | <strong>3+</strong> same row | First 4 reels |
| 4-3 of 10 | <strong>5+</strong> OR <strong>4</strong> same row | First 3 reels |
| 2-1 of 10 | <strong>6+</strong> OR <strong>4</strong> same row | First 3 reels |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Spin 10 of 10 (wilds activate THIS spin, too late)
- Frames not connected horizontally (early in cycle)
- Frames have gaps (wheel bonus blocks line hits)

---

STOP WHEN:
- Spin 10 completes (frames turn wild, board resets)

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing spin 10 of 10 (no value left)
- Focusing on 3-of-a-kind setups (pays poorly)
- Not prioritizing horizontal connections
- Missing that wheel bonus can block line hits

---

IMAGES:

  Image 2: /images/games/wheel-of-fortune-wild-spin-2.jpg
  Image 3: /images/games/wheel-of-fortune-wild-spin-3.jpg - This walk-up play resulted in a $66 win on a $2 investment. Five-of-a-kind wilds, like on the top two rows, pay very well.

GUIDE 103: Wild Explosion: Get‘Cha Gold / Get‘Cha Money / Get‘Cha Reward / Get‘Cha Treasure
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Red wilds with countdown timer in reels 2 or 3 (any countdown value) | Red wilds in reel 4 with countdown of 2 or 3 (play for chance to land reel 2-3 wild) | Listen for ticking sound indicating active timers

STOP PLAYING:
After all red wild countdowns reach 0 and explode or fizzle (no red wilds remaining)

HOW IT WORKS:
Wild Explosion features **red wilds with countdown timers that explode**:

**Game Variants:**
- Get'Cha Gold
- Get'Cha Money
- Get'Cha Reward
- Get'Cha Treasure

**Mechanic:**
- Red wilds land with countdown timer (starts at 3)
- Timer counts down each spin
- Timer reaches 0 → Usually (not always) explodes
- Explosion releases up to <strong>9</strong> wilds around it
- One explosion → ALL red wilds explode (chain reaction)

**Audio Cue:**
- Ticking sound = Active countdown timers

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Red wilds only under "Wild Explosion" bet levels on bet pad.**

| Red Wild Location | Countdown | Action |
|-------------------|-----------|--------|
| Reels 2 or 3 | Any (1, 2, or 3) | ✅ **Play** |
| Reel 4 | 2 or 3 | ✅ **Play** (chance to land reel 2-3 wild) |
| Reel 4 | 1 | ❌ Skip (not enough spins) |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- No red wilds with countdown timers
- Reel 4 wild with countdown of 1 only
- Only blue wilds visible (not persistent)

---

STOP WHEN:
- All red wild countdowns reach 0 and explode or fizzle
- No red wilds remaining

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing non-Wild Explosion bet levels (no red wilds)
- Confusing blue wilds with red wilds (blue disappear)
- Not listening for ticking sound
- Expecting consistent explosions (can fizzle)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/wild-explosion-getcha-gold--getcha-money--getcha-reward--getcha-treasure-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/wild-explosion-getcha-gold--getcha-money--getcha-reward--getcha-treasure-2.jpg - The number next to the red wilds in reels two and four shows how many spins remain before the bomb may explode, releasing up to nine adjacent wilds.
  Image 3: /images/games/wild-explosion-getcha-gold--getcha-money--getcha-reward--getcha-treasure-3.jpg - When the red wilds explode and add a bunch of wilds in a horizontal manner like this, you can get huge line hits.
  Image 4: /images/games/wild-explosion-getcha-gold--getcha-money--getcha-reward--getcha-treasure-4.jpg - During the free games feature, the red wilds always explode when one reaches 0. Therefore, you can get big wins like this nearly 200x bonus.
  Image 5: /images/games/wild-explosion-getcha-gold--getcha-money--getcha-reward--getcha-treasure-5.jpg - You only need to check the bet levels under the Wild Explosion bets on the bet pad.
  Image 6: /images/games/wild-explosion-getcha-gold--getcha-money--getcha-reward--getcha-treasure-6.jpg - The older versions of the game have physical buttons on the bet pad, but they play the same.


==================================================
GUIDE 104: Wild Force: Bison Sunrise / Midnight Wolf
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
5+ frames connected horizontally starting from reel 1 (ignore frames showing

STOP PLAYING:
After Wild Spark triggers and connected frames turn wild

HOW IT WORKS:
Wild Force features **locked frames that turn wild on Wild Spark**:

**Game Variants:**
- Bison Sunrise
- Midnight Wolf

**Mechanic:**
- Frames lock on reels (glowing borders when connected)
- Spin symbol in middle reel → Selector wheel spins
- Wild Spark on wheel → Connected frames turn wild
- Only frames connected horizontally/vertically turn wild

**Selector Wheel Options:**
| Result | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Wild Spark | Triggers wilds on connected frames |
| Up to 10 frames | Adds 3-10 extra locked frames |
| Up to 15 frames | Adds 5-15 extra locked frames |
| Up to 20 frames | Adds 7-20 extra locked frames |
| Mega Reel | Credit prizes, jackpots, or free games |

---

PLAY WHEN:
| Setup | Action |
|-------|--------|
| <strong>5+</strong> frames connected horizontally starting from reel 1 | ✅ **Play** |
| <strong>13+</strong> frames anywhere (regardless of connections) | ✅ **Play** |

**General Guidelines (5-13 frames):**
- Look for connected frames starting in reel 1
- Avoid frames concentrated on right side
- Need 5 wilds in a payline for good payout
- Paylines can be shaped, not just straight

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Frames showing "Wild" (disappear next spin)
- All frames concentrated on right side
- Fewer than 5 connected or 13 total

---

STOP WHEN:
- Wild Spark triggers and connected frames turn wild

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Counting "Wild" frames (they disappear)
- Playing without 5+ connected or 13+ total
- Not prioritizing left-side connections
- Expecting strong line hits (they're weak on this game)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/wild-force-bison-sunrise--midnight-wolf-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/wild-force-bison-sunrise--midnight-wolf-2.jpg - The game comes in a tall cabinet with a huge wheel at the top, so it is easy to spot inside casinos.
  Image 3: /images/games/wild-force-bison-sunrise--midnight-wolf-3.jpg - The Spin symbol landed in the middle reel, which triggered the Wild Spark feature on the selector wheel. All of the frames connected horizontally and vertically turned wild.
  Image 4: /images/games/wild-force-bison-sunrise--midnight-wolf-4.jpg - Setups like this might look tempting to play, but I would pass on this. Unless you connect many more frames, the payout just won’t cover the cost to trigger the Wild Spark feature.
  Image 5: /images/games/wild-force-bison-sunrise--midnight-wolf-5.jpg - This was a bad play that I took. Even with the three wilds across the top row, it paid less than the bet amount.
  Image 6: /images/games/wild-force-bison-sunrise--midnight-wolf-6.jpg - These are the kind of boards you need to get a nice win.
  Image 7: /images/games/wild-force-bison-sunrise--midnight-wolf-7.jpg - You need to form a payline with five wilds to get a decent payout.


==================================================
GUIDE 105: Wish Mistress
==================================================

Category: accumulation
Volatility: medium
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
2 meters at 3 gems each (one spin away from double trigger) | 5+ combined blue and yellow gems (prioritize blue over yellow, avoid red-heavy setups)

STOP PLAYING:
After wild feature triggers and gem meter(s) reset to zero

HOW IT WORKS:
Wish Mistress features **gem collection** that triggers wild features:

**Mechanic:**
- Collect blue, red, and yellow gems
- <strong>4</strong> gems of single color → Activates wilds feature
- Goal: Trigger 2 colors simultaneously for good payout

**Gem Value Hierarchy:**
| Color | Wild Type | Value |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Blue | Full reel wilds | Best |
| Yellow | Surrounding wilds | Medium |
| Red | Random position wilds | Worst |

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — Double Trigger Setup:**
- <strong>2</strong> meters at <strong>3</strong> gems each
- (One gem away from double trigger)

**Option B — Blue + Yellow Focus:**
- <strong>5+</strong> combined blue and yellow gems
- (Prioritize blue over yellow, avoid red-heavy)

| Gems | Blue+Yellow | Action |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 3+3 (two meters) | Any | ✅ **Play** |
| Any | 5+ | ✅ **Play** |
| Single meter at 3 | Below 5 | ❌ Skip |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Only one meter at 3 gems
- Red-heavy gem distribution
- Combined blue + yellow below <strong>5</strong>

---

STOP WHEN:
- Wild feature triggers
- Gem meter(s) reset to zero

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing single color at 3 gems (usually doesn't pay well)
- Prioritizing red gems (least lucrative)
- Not recognizing double trigger potential

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/wish-mistress-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/wish-mistress-2.jpg - This is an excellent play with both blue and yellow one gem away from triggering. Ideally, you want to hit two wild features at once.


==================================================
GUIDE 106: WIZARD RICHES
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
DELAYED WILDS: 2+ connected purple-border symbols in first 4 reels, or 3 in first 3, or 4 in first 4 | COUNTDOWN JACKPOTS: 2 adjacent jackpot icons with yellow indicators remaining | LEFT BOOKCASE: 6x+ bet win in last 5 wins (top shelf = better odds, 4x+ acceptable) | RIGHT BOOKCASE: 4x+ multiplier with empty shelf inside purple border (not if Next Win already highlighted)

STOP PLAYING:
After delayed wilds trigger (1 spin only) | After multiplier applies to a win | After jackpot won

HOW IT WORKS:
Wizard Riches has **multiple advantage opportunities** (complicated but lucrative):

**Four Advantage Types:**
1. Delayed Wilds (purple border symbols)
2. Countdown Jackpots (icons at top)
3. Past Mystery Multipliers (left bookcase)
4. Future Mystery Multipliers (right bookcase)

---

PLAY WHEN:
N/A

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Delayed wilds only in reel 1 (don't appear there)
- Countdown jackpots with 0 indicators (disappear next spin)
- Right bookcase multiplier with full shelves inside purple border
- "Next Win" already highlighted

---

STOP WHEN:
- Delayed wilds trigger (1 spin only)
- Multiplier applies to a win
- Jackpot won

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing delayed wilds for more than 1 spin
- Not recognizing yellow countdown indicators
- Playing right bookcase when shelves are full
- Ignoring left bookcase (touch to illuminate)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/wizard-riches-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/wizard-riches-2.jpg
  Image 3: /images/games/wizard-riches-3.jpg - This is an excellent play because all of the symbols with the glowing purple borders will turn wild on the next spin.
  Image 4: /images/games/wizard-riches-4.jpg - This is a play because there are two empty shelves within the purple border on the right side bookcase.
  Image 5: /images/games/wizard-riches-5.jpg - This is NOT a play because the 4x multiplier will disappear next spin (because the shelves within the purple border are full).
  Image 6: /images/games/wizard-riches-6.jpg - This is a play because the next win will be multiplied by 5x.
  Image 7: /images/games/wizard-riches-7.jpg - This is NOT a play because the 5x multiplier will disappear next spin.


==================================================
GUIDE 107: WOLF PEAK / CAT PEAK / FU REN
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Yellow wilds with chevron arrows in reels 1-3 (any size) | Reel 4 yellow wilds only if they have 2x/3x multipliers | Check full wild rows for hidden arrow inside | Must insert money to check

STOP PLAYING:
After all yellow wilds fully expand and disappear

HOW IT WORKS:
Wolf Peak features **expanding wilds that persist for 4 spins**:

**Game Variants:**
- Wolf Peak
- Cat Peak
- Fu Ren Wu (Asian theme)

**Mechanic:**
- Yellow wilds with chevron arrows (up/down) = Active
- Expand one row each spin until covering entire reel (4 tall)
- Stay for <strong>4</strong> spins total
- Disappear after fully expanding

**Wild Types:**
| Color | Persistence |
|-------|-------------|
| **YELLOW** (with chevron arrow) | ✅ Expands and persists |
| **PURPLE** | ❌ Disappears next spin |

---

PLAY WHEN:
| Setup | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Yellow wilds in reels 1-3 (any size) | ✅ **Play** |
| Reel 4 yellow wilds with 2x/3x multiplier | ✅ **Play** |
| Reel 4 yellow wilds without multiplier | ❌ Skip |
| Reel 5 wilds only | ❌ Skip |
| Purple wilds only | ❌ Skip |

**CRITICAL:** Check full wild rows for hidden arrow inside - new wild can land on existing full row.

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Only purple wilds visible (not persistent)
- Yellow wilds only in reel 5
- Reel 4 wilds without multipliers

---

STOP WHEN:
- All yellow wilds fully expand and disappear

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing purple wilds (they don't persist)
- Missing arrows hidden inside full wild rows
- Playing reel 4 wilds without multipliers
- Not checking carefully (requires money in machine)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/wolf-peak-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/wolf-peak-2.jpg - Do not play the purple wilds that look like this—they don’t stick around like the yellow ones.
  Image 3: /images/games/wolf-peak-3.jpg - The expanding wilds in reel five aren’t worth playing.
  Image 4: /images/games/wolf-peak-4.jpg - This was an amazing walk-up play that I found.
  Image 5: /images/games/wolf-peak-5.jpg - The next spin after finding this play was a $193.65 win (on only an $0.80 bet).
  Image 6: /images/games/wolf-peak-6.jpg
  Image 7: /images/games/wolf-peak-7.jpg - Fu Ren Wu is an Asian-themed clone of Wolf Peak.

GUIDE 108: WOLF RIDGE
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Free games, blue prizes, or 50x+ green prizes in reel 2 or 4 (1 spin to win) | Same valuable prizes in reels 3 AND 5 together (2 spins, 2 chances) | Blue prize in reel 5 (2 spins to reach Alpha reel for 3x multiplier)

STOP PLAYING:
After wolf symbol lands and prize collected | Target prize shifts off left side of screen

HOW IT WORKS:
Wolf Ridge features a **Prize Disk** above the reels:

**Mechanic:**
- Prize Disk shifts **left one position** each spin
- Wolf symbol lands in reel 1, 3, or 5 → Win prize above that reel
- Middle reel (Alpha) prizes get <strong>3x</strong> multiplier
- Prize types: Free games, blue credits, green credits, yellow credits

**Prize Value Hierarchy:**
| Prize Type | Value |
|------------|-------|
| Free games | High |
| Blue credits | High |
| Green 50x+ | Worth playing |
| Green below 50x | Skip |
| Yellow | Skip |

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — Reel 2 or 4 (1 Spin):**
- Free games, blue prize, or green <strong>50x+</strong> in reel 2 or 4
- Play <strong>1</strong> spin

**Option B — Reels 3 AND 5 (2 Spins):**
- Valuable prizes in **both** reels 3 and 5
- Play <strong>2</strong> spins (2 chances to win on second spin)

**Option C — Alpha Reel Setup:**
- Any green prize in reel 4 → Play <strong>1</strong> spin
- Any blue prize in reel 5 → Play <strong>2</strong> spins (reaches Alpha for 3x)

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Prizes only in reel 1 (shift off screen next spin)
- Green prizes below <strong>50x</strong> bet
- Yellow prizes only

---

STOP WHEN:
- Wolf symbol lands and prize collected
- Target prize shifts off left side of screen

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing reel 1 prizes (shift off screen next spin)
- Playing small green prizes (need 50x+ bet)
- Not recognizing Alpha reel 3x multiplier value

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/wolf-ridge-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/wolf-ridge-2.jpg
  Image 3: /images/games/wolf-ridge-3.jpg - This is an excellent play. On the next spin, the blue $250 prize will shift into the Alpha reel, where it will get a 3x multiplier, making it a potential win of $750 on a $3.75 bet.
  Image 4: /images/games/wolf-ridge-4.jpg - This was a $37.50 investment (notice the 10¢ denom) for a chance at an $1,800 win.


==================================================
GUIDE 109: WOLF RUN ECLIPSE
==================================================

Category: must-hit-by
Volatility: low
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Mini (blue) 30+ free games | Minor (purple) 40+ free games | Major (orange) 65+ free games | Never chase Mega (check bet pad for all counts)

STOP PLAYING:
After triggering free games feature for targeted meter

HOW IT WORKS:
Wolf Run Eclipse / Cats Wild Serengeti features **four progressive free games meters** (NOT must-hit-by):

**Meter Types:**
| Meter | Color | Resets To | Wild Reels Per Spin |
|-------|-------|-----------|---------------------|
| Mini | Blue | 5 | 1 full reel |
| Minor | Purple | 5 | 2 full reels |
| Major | Orange | 5 | 3 full reels |
| Mega | Green | 100 | 3 full reels |

**Mechanic:**
- Free games symbol lands in reel 4 → Corresponding meter increases
- Bonus triggered → Win accumulated free games
- Completely random when bonus triggers (NOT must-hit-by)

---

PLAY WHEN:
| Meter | Color | Free Games Threshold |
|-------|-------|---------------------|
| Mini | Blue | ≥ <strong>30</strong> |
| Minor | Purple | ≥ <strong>40</strong> |
| Major | Orange | ≥ <strong>65</strong> |
| Mega | Green | ❌ **NEVER** |

**How to Check:**
- Look directly on bet pad
- Shows free games count for all bet levels

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Mini below <strong>30</strong> free games
- Minor below <strong>40</strong> free games
- Major below <strong>65</strong> free games
- **NEVER** chase Mega directly
- You are a newer AP with limited bankroll

---

STOP WHEN:
- Free games bonus triggers for targeted meter
- You hit your loss limit (set one before playing)

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Chasing Mega (nearly impossible to hit directly)
- Thinking more spins = closer to hitting (NOT TRUE)
- Chasing without adequate bankroll
- Not setting a loss limit before playing

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/wolf-run-eclipse-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/wolf-run-eclipse-3.jpg - Cats Wild Serengeti is a newer sister title to Wolf Run Eclipse.
  Image 3: /images/games/wolf-run-eclipse-4.jpg - The mega might seem high at 147 free games, but it starts at 100. It’s nearly impossible to hit, so I don’t recommend ever directly chasing it.
  Image 4: /images/games/wolf-run-eclipse-5.jpg - Even the mini can pay very well when the number of free games runs this high.


==================================================
GUIDE 110: WU DRAGON / STAR GODDESS
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
7+ frames in first 4 reels with 5+ in reels 2-3 | 6+ frames in first 4 reels with 3+ connected horizontally | 4+ frames in same row | Only check BOTTOM row bets (Portal Lock feature)

STOP PLAYING:
After fireball hits frame and all frames turn wild (frames disappear next spin)

HOW IT WORKS:
Wu Dragon / Star Goddess features **persistent frames** with fireball mechanic:

**Mechanic:**
- Frames lock onto reels
- Fireball shoots from upper right occasionally
- Fireball hits frame → That frame + all other frames turn WILD
- Fireball also turns adjacent symbols wild (3 above, 3 below, 1 each side)
- Frames disappear next spin after triggered

**Goal:** 5-of-a-kind line hits (4-of-a-kind pays poorly, 3-of-a-kind barely pays)

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Only check **BOTTOM row bets** (Portal Lock feature). Top row frames are NOT persistent.

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — Seven Frames:**
- <strong>7+</strong> frames in first four reels
- WITH <strong>5+</strong> frames in reels 2-3

**Option B — Six Frames + Horizontal:**
- <strong>6+</strong> frames in first four reels
- WITH <strong>3+</strong> frames connected horizontally

**Option C — Full Row:**
- <strong>4+</strong> frames in same row
- (Don't need to be connected)

| Frames in R1-4 | Reels 2-3 | Horizontal | Action |
|----------------|-----------|------------|--------|
| 7+ | 5+ | Any | ✅ **Play** |
| 6+ | Any | 3+ | ✅ **Play** |
| 4+ same row | Any | N/A | ✅ **Play** |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Checking top row bets (frames not persistent)
- Frames concentrated on right side only
- Frames only in reel 1 (can't expand left)
- Fewer than 6 frames with poor distribution

---

STOP WHEN:
- Fireball hits frame
- All frames turn wild
- Frames disappear next spin

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Checking top row bets (frames NOT persistent—only Portal Lock)
- Not understanding fireball expansion mechanic
- Expecting 3-of-a-kind or 4-of-a-kind to pay well
- Playing reel 1 heavy boards (fireball can't expand left)

---

IMAGES:
  Image 1: /images/games/wu-dragon-1.jpg
  Image 2: /images/games/wu-dragon-2.jpg - This is the ideal kind of play you are looking for. You are guaranteed five wilds across on the second row from the top and five-of-a-kind on the bottom row.
  Image 3: /images/games/wu-dragon-3.jpg
  Image 4: /images/games/wu-dragon-4.jpg - Entire rows of wilds pay very well. Even with the bonus symbol blocking me on the bottom row, this was a nice win.
  Image 5: /images/games/wu-dragon-5.jpg - Only check the bottom row bets with the Portal Lock feature. The frames in the top row bets are not persistent—they disappear after every spin.
  Image 6: /images/games/wu-dragon-6.jpg - This is an awesome walk-up play I found. It’s common to find scenarios like this where ploppies play for a while and then give up because the machine isn’t paying out.

GUIDE 111: Ying Cai Shen
==================================================

Category: accumulation
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
Active wild on reel 3 (red banner | 2 coins below) | Active wilds on BOTH reels 4 and 5 | Reel 4 wild with 2 spins remaining + 1 coin in reel 3 (play 1 spin for potential double wild)

STOP PLAYING:
After wild reel(s) expire (banner gone, coins empty)

HOW IT WORKS:
Ying Cai Shen features **coin holders** below reels 3, 4, and 5 only:

**Mechanic:**
- Coins land below reels 3, 4, 5
- <strong>2</strong> coins fills holder → Reel turns WILD for <strong>2</strong> spins
- Wild reel shows red banner when active

**Active Wild Indicators:**
| State | Coins Below | Banner | Spins Left |
|-------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Not active | 0-1 | No | 0 |
| Active (2 spins) | 2 | Yes (red) | 2 |
| Active (1 spin) | 1 | Yes (red) | 1 |

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — Reel 3 Active:**
- Reel 3 has active wild
- (2 coins below OR 1 coin + red banner)

**Option B — Reels 4 AND 5 Active:**
- **Both** reels 4 and 5 have active wilds

**Option C — One-Spin Gamble:**
- Reel 4 active with <strong>2</strong> spins remaining
- AND <strong>1</strong> coin below reel 3
- Play **1 spin only** to try landing 2nd coin in reel 3
- If no coin lands → Stop immediately

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Reel 4 or 5 active alone (not both)
- Only 1 coin in reels 3 and 4 (not +EV)
- Active wild about to expire with no coins below

---

STOP WHEN:
- Wild reel(s) expire (banner gone, coins empty)
- One-spin gamble failed (no coin landed in reel 3)

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing 1 coin in reels 3 and 4 (not +EV)
- Playing single active wild in reel 4 or 5
- Not recognizing active wild indicators (banner + coins)
- Not checking all denominations

---

GUIDE 112: ZODIAC LION / ZODIAC DRAGON
==================================================

Category: counter-meter
Volatility: high
Min Bet: $0.88

LOOK FOR:
4+ gold frames connected horizontally spanning reels 1-4 or 2-5 | 3+ horizontal frames starting in reel 1 or 2 with 8+ total connected | Avoid frames only in reels 3-4-5 with no connection to reels 1-2 | Check for Lion Spin Bonus leftovers (lion heads become frames next spin)

STOP PLAYING:
After lion/dragon head lands in a gold frame (all connected frames turn wild, then disappear next spin)

HOW IT WORKS:
Zodiac Lion / Zodiac Dragon features **persistent gold frames**:

**Mechanic:**
- Lion/dragon head lands → Creates gold frame
- Another head lands IN any frame → All connected frames turn WILD
- Frames disappear next spin after triggered
- Goal: 4-of-a-kind or 5-of-a-kind line hits (3-of-a-kind pays poorly)

---

PLAY WHEN:
**Option A — Four Horizontal Frames:**
- <strong>4+</strong> gold frames connected horizontally
- Must span reels 1-4 OR reels 2-5

**Option B — Three Horizontal + Large Clump:**
- <strong>3+</strong> horizontal frames starting in reel 1 or 2
- <strong>8+</strong> total connected frames in that clump

| Horizontal Span | Total Clump | Action |
|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| Reels 1-4 | Any | ✅ **Play** |
| Reels 2-5 | Any | ✅ **Play** |
| Reels 1-3 or 2-4 | 8+ | ✅ **Play** |
| Reels 3-5 only | Any | ❌ Skip |

---

DO NOT PLAY WHEN:
- Frames only in reels 3-4-5 (no connection to reels 1-2)
- Frames connected vertically but not horizontally
- Random scattered frames not connected horizontally

---

STOP WHEN:
- Lion/dragon head lands in gold frame
- All connected frames turn wild
- Frames disappear next spin

---

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Playing any bunch of frames regardless of position (common mistake)
- Playing reels 3-4-5 clumps with no connection to left reels
- Expecting 3-of-a-kind to pay well (need 4+ of a kind)
- Not recognizing horizontal vs vertical connections matter

IMAGES:

  Image 2: /images/games/zodiac-lion--zodiac-dragon-2.jpg - Attempting to connect gold frames on the left side to gold frames on the right side is risky. Scroll down to see the results of this attempt.
  Image 3: /images/games/zodiac-lion--zodiac-dragon-3.jpg
  Image 4: /images/games/zodiac-lion--zodiac-dragon-4.jpg - I would definitely still play this, but having holes in the middle like this really cut into the payout.
  Image 5: /images/games/zodiac-lion--zodiac-dragon-5.jpg - I considered playing this but decided to pass. If there was one more gold frame connecting horizontally on either the top or bottom clump, then I would play.
  Image 6: /images/games/zodiac-lion--zodiac-dragon-6.jpg - Avoid plays like this where the gold frames are concentrated in reels three, four and five.
  Image 7: /images/games/zodiac-lion--zodiac-dragon-7.jpg - Watch for plays like this that are the result of the previous player cashing out after the Lion Spin Bonus. Scroll down to see what the next spin will look like.
  Image 8: /images/games/zodiac-lion--zodiac-dragon-8.jpg - The leftover lion heads from the Lion Spin Bonus are now gold frames.
  Image 9: /images/games/zodiac-lion--zodiac-dragon-9.jpg
  Image 10: /images/games/zodiac-lion--zodiac-dragon-10.jpg - Zodiac Dragon isn’t nearly as common as Zodiac Lion, but it plays exactly the same.
