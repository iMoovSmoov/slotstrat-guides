## How The Advantage Works

Super Bowl Jackpots features **2-Minute Drill with persistent prizes**:

**Mechanic:**
- 2-Minute Drill activates bank-wide every <strong>22-26</strong> minutes
- Red timer counts down from 2 minutes
- Credit prizes land → Added to <strong>4</strong> spots above reels
- Fill all 4 spots consecutively → Win all collected prizes
- Any spin with no prize → Board clears

**Key Insight:**
- The 2-Minute Drill itself is NOT +EV
- Collected prizes PERSIST after feature ends
- Prizes remaining = +EV opportunity

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: DON'T FAST-SPIN THE DRILL

**Game rules state:** "Return to player remains the same between regular mode and 2-Minute Drill."

The collected prizes make it +EV, NOT the feature itself.

---

## PLAY WHEN

**Simple Rule:**
- 2-Minute Drill active (red timer) AND
- <strong>1+</strong> prizes collected in any of the 4 spots

| Spots Filled | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| 1+ prizes | ✅ **Play** |
| 0 prizes | ❌ Skip |

**Variance Reduction:**
- Avoid plays where total collected < bet size

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- No prizes collected in any spot
- 2-Minute Drill not active
- Entire drill from start (not +EV)

---

## STOP WHEN

- All 4 spots filled (prizes awarded)
- Any spin lands with no prize (board clears)

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Fast-spinning through entire 2-Minute Drill
- Not checking all bet levels (prizes stored separately)
- Thinking the drill itself is +EV
- Not setting phone reminders for next activation

---

## Additional Notes

**Checking the Machine:**
- Must insert ticket and select team to check
- **TIP:** Tap a different bet level to bypass team selection
- Check all bet levels (prizes stored independently)
- No indicator on bet pad shows which bets have prizes

**Activation Timing:**
- Airhorn sound when drill activates (listen for it)
- Activates even with no players
- Set phone reminder for 20 minutes after you see it
- Check bank every 45 minutes if high traffic

**What Can Be Collected:**
- Credit prizes
- Mini, Minor, Maxi, Major, Grand jackpots

**Underrated Game:**
- Most APs think it's a trap or waste of time
- Actually very profitable for short sessions
- Common in most casinos
- Worth adding to rotation
