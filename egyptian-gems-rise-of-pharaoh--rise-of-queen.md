## How The Advantage Works

Egyptian Gems features **orbs with credit prizes** that move across the reels:

**Mechanic:**
- Orbs appear in queue (right side, above reels)
- Pyramid symbol lands → Bottom orb drops to reel 6 on same row
- Each spin → Orbs move **left one position**
- Orb lands on pyramid symbol → Win credit prize
- Orb triggered → Chance for Inner Reel Feature

**Orb Value Hierarchy:**
| Color | Prize Value |
|-------|-------------|
| 🟡 Yellow | Highest |
| 🔴 Red | Medium |
| 🔵 Blue | Lowest |

---

## PLAY WHEN (ANY ONE)

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Do NOT count orbs in reel 1—they exit next spin.

**Option A — Yellow Orbs (On Reels):**
- Any yellow orb on reels <strong>2–6</strong>
- OR yellow orb in **bottom position** of queue

**Option B — Yellow Orbs (Queue):**
- <strong>2+</strong> yellow orbs anywhere in queue

**Option C — Red Orbs:**
- <strong>4+</strong> red orbs total

**Option D — Volume Play:**
- <strong>6+</strong> orbs of **any color**
- Value: Increased free games bonus chance (not credit prizes)

| Orbs Present | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| Yellow on reels 2–6 or bottom queue | ✅ **Play** |
| 2+ yellow anywhere in queue | ✅ **Play** |
| 4+ red orbs | ✅ **Play** |
| 6+ orbs any color | ✅ **Play** (bonus chance) |

**How to Check (Free):**
- Tap menu icon (lower left)
- Use up/down arrows to cycle bet levels
- No ticket required

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Only counting orbs in reel 1 (they exit next spin)
- Fewer than 4 red orbs (and no yellow)
- Fewer than 6 total orbs (and no yellow/red setup)
- Only blue orbs with low count

---

## STOP WHEN

- All orbs have moved off reel 1
- Free games bonus completes

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Counting orbs in reel 1 (they're gone next spin)
- Ignoring blue orbs for volume plays (6+ orbs gives bonus chance)
- Not checking queue for upcoming yellow orbs
- Missing that orbs can be triggered multiple times

---

## Additional Notes

**Inner Reel Feature:**
- Triggered when orb wins
- Awards: Multiplier (2x–50x), Major/Grand jackpot, or free games bonus

**Orb Behavior:**
- Orbs don't disappear after triggering (can win multiple times)
- Credit prizes revealed when orbs drop from queue
- Multiple pyramids in same row = Multiplied orb value

**Game Variants:**
- Rise of Pharaoh ✅
- Rise of Queen ✅
- Both play the same

**Volatility:**
- High variance
- Orbs difficult to trigger
- Expect losses, make up with bonus/multiplier wins

**Free Check Method:**
1. Tap menu icon (lower left corner)
2. Use up/down arrows to cycle bet levels
3. View orb positions without inserting ticket
