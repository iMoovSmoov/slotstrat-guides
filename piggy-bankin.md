## How The Advantage Works

Piggy Bankin' features a **jackpot pick bonus** with the following mechanics:

- <strong>510</strong> total coins spread across <strong>9</strong> piggy banks
- <strong>1</strong> lucky coin hidden randomly triggers the bonus
- Landing multiplier symbols → Coins added to bank
- After <strong>60</strong> coins collected → Large pig breaks, smaller pig walks up
- Fewer pigs = **Higher chance** of finding lucky coin

---

## ACCUMULATION STATE

| Pigs Remaining | State | Action |
|----------------|-------|--------|
| 7–9 pigs | ❌ No | Walk away |
| 4–6 pigs | ❌ No | Walk away |
| ≤3 pigs | ✅ Yes | **Play** |

**How to Count:**
- Count the **large pig on top** (1)
- Count the **smaller pigs below** (up to 8)
- Total = Large pig + Small pigs

---

## PLAY WHEN

<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- Total pigs remaining: ≤ <strong>3</strong>

<strong>Before Playing:</strong>
- Verify game version matches guide photos
- Count ALL pigs (top + bottom)

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** There are multiple versions of Piggy Bankin' (including Lock It Link). Ensure you have the correct version.

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- More than <strong>3</strong> pigs remaining
- Game version doesn't match guide photos
- You miscounted pigs (recount before committing)

---

## STOP WHEN

- Jackpot pick bonus triggers (lucky coin found)
- All pigs reset after bonus

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Forgetting to count the large pig on top
- Playing the wrong version of Piggy Bankin'
- Playing at 4+ pigs (not +EV)
- Confusing this with Lock It Link version

---

## Additional Notes

**Coin Accumulation:**
