- Activated symbols that land → Transform into sliding banners
- Sliding banners reveal random matching symbols
- All 4 cards active → Massive line hit potential

**Card Symbols:**
- ♠️ Spade
- ♥️ Heart
- ♦️ Diamond
- ♣️ Club

## CURRENT STATE

| Cards Active | Spins Remaining | State | Action |
|--------------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| 0–1 | Any | ❌ Cold | Walk away |
| 2 | 1–4 each | ❌ Risky | Walk away |
| 2 | 5+ each | ⚠️ Aggressive | Playable (high variance) |
| 3+ | Any | ✅ **Play** | Good value |
| 4 | Any | 🔥 Excellent | Massive potential |

---

## PLAY WHEN (ANY ONE)

**Option A — Three Active (Recommended):**
- <strong>3+</strong> card symbols active above reels
- Check spin counter below each card

**Option B — Two Active (Aggressive):**
- <strong>2</strong> card symbols active
- Both have <strong>5+</strong> spins remaining
- Higher variance, but activating 3rd card covers losses

**How to Check:**
- Look at bet pad for active card count
- Spin counter visible below each card symbol

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Fewer than <strong>2</strong> card symbols active
- Only 2 active with fewer than <strong>5</strong> spins each
- All counters about to expire

---

## STOP WHEN

- All card symbol activations expire (counters reach 0)
- Re-evaluate after any banner lands

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Playing with only 1 active card symbol
- Playing 2 active cards with low spin counts
- Forgetting this is NOT all-ways-pay (need line hits)
- Not checking bet pad for card status

---

## Additional Notes

**Win Potential:**
- Full screen of banners → Up to <strong>240x</strong> (premium symbol)
- 100x line hits possible with right setup
- Low cost per play, losses covered by occasional huge hits

**Banner Refresh:**
- Landing 2-high banner for already-active card → Resets to <strong>7</strong> spins

**Game Variants:**
- Aztec Banner ✅
- Pegasus Banner ✅
- Same strategy for both

**Line Hits Required:**
- NOT all-ways-pay
- Must form actual line hits to win

**Denominations:**
