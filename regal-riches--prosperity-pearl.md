## How The Advantage Works

Regal Riches / Prosperity Pearl features **MHB progressive wilds**:

**Mechanic:**
- Wilds accumulate in meters
- Blue wilds: Base game (counter above middle reel)
- Purple/Green/Yellow wilds: Awarded during free games feature

**Meter Structure:**
| Color | Type | Resets To | MHB | Avg Payout at MHB |
|-------|------|-----------|-----|-------------------|
| Blue | Base game | 5 | 50 | Varies |
| Purple | Minor | 30 | 75 | 75x bet |
| Green | Major | 40 | 100 | 150x bet |
| Yellow | Mega | 50 | 125 | 225x bet |

**Wild Multipliers:**
- Wilds landing on wilds = Multipliers (up to 5x)
- Multiple multipliers on same row = Huge payouts

---

## PLAY WHEN

**Break-Even Thresholds (wait higher for more profit):**

| Progressive | Play At | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| Blue (base game) | <strong>8+</strong> | Most common find |
| Purple (minor) | <strong>61+</strong> | Accumulates fastest |
| Green (major) | <strong>84+</strong> | Accumulates slower |
| Yellow (mega) | <strong>112+</strong> | ⚠️ Large bankroll required |

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Blue at 7 (common AP trap - others "sell" 7's to naive players)
- Meters below thresholds
- Yellow without adequate bankroll

---

## STOP WHEN

- Free games feature triggers and wilds are awarded

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Playing blue 7's (not +EV)
- Chasing yellow without large bankroll
- Not checking blue (requires tapping bet levels)
- Getting excited during "suspense spin" (rarely triggers)

---

## Additional Notes

**Accumulation Speed:**
- Purple: Fastest (most common chase)
- Green: Slower (occasional chase)
- Yellow: Slowest (rare chase)

**Yellow Warning:**
- Pays very well but can drain bankroll
- Common to see players abandon mid-chase
- Prime opportunity to jump in when others quit

**Free Games Feature:**
- Triggered randomly OR guaranteed at MHB
- 10 free games
- Wilds saved for "grand finale" on final spin

**Free Check Method:**
- Bet pad shows purple/green/yellow meters (just glance)
- Blue requires tapping bet levels to see

**Nerf Rumors:**
- Some believe Regal Riches was "nerfed" (lower blue runs)
- Prosperity Pearl may run blues higher (12-13 vs 9-10)
- Unconfirmed - may just be variance

**Hustler Tactics:**
- Many APs take plays early to demoralize competition
- Don't let this pressure you into bad plays

**RTP Range:**
- 85% to 96%
