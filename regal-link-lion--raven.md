## How The Advantage Works

Regal Link features **cash wilds with MHB meters**:

**Game Variants:**
- Regal Link: Lion
- Regal Link: Raven

**Key Difference from Regal Riches:**
- Wilds accrue MUCH more slowly
- Cash wilds (contain credit prizes) instead of standard wilds
- More volatile bonuses
- **Play TIGHTER than Regal Riches**

**Meter Structure:**
| Meter | Color | Starts At | MHB |
|-------|-------|-----------|-----|
| Silver | Silver | Base game | N/A |
| Amber | Orange | 30 | 50 |
| Sapphire | Blue | 40 | 60 |
| Amethyst | Purple | 50 | 75 |
| Emerald | Green | 75 | 100 |
| Diamond | Yellow | 175 | 200 |

## ⚠️ BORDERLINE AP TRAP

**Not like original Regal Riches:**
- Wilds accrue much more slowly
- Positive equity exists but requires patience
- Wait for numbers VERY close to MHB
- Meters trigger early frequently

---

## PLAY WHEN

**Single Meter Thresholds:**

| Meter | Play At | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Silver (base game) | <strong>9+</strong> | Most common find |
| Amber (orange) | <strong>47+</strong> | |
| Sapphire (blue) | <strong>58+</strong> | |
| Amethyst (purple) | <strong>73+</strong> | |
| Emerald (green) | <strong>98+</strong> | |
| Diamond (yellow) | <strong>199+</strong> | ⚠️ See warning below |

**Multiple Meter Bonus:**
- If 2 meters are close to playable, play <strong>1</strong> number early on each
- Example: 46 amber + 57 sapphire = ✅ Play

---

## ⚠️ DIAMOND WARNING

**NEVER jump in early on diamond (yellow):**
- APs have lost <strong>3,000+</strong> units chasing at 197
- Can take 12+ hours to trigger
- Wait for <strong>199</strong> minimum

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Meters below thresholds
- Diamond at 197-198 (trap)
- Only one meter slightly below threshold (no combo bonus)

---

## STOP WHEN

- Free games feature triggers and cash wilds are awarded

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Playing like original Regal Riches (different game)
- Jumping in early on diamond
- Not recognizing cash wilds vs standard wilds
- Missing silver wilds (most common playable find)

---

## Additional Notes

**Silver Wilds Most Common:**
- Shown directly above middle reel
- Very lucrative at 12+
- Easiest meter to find playable

**Cash Wilds:**
- Function as standard wilds
- Also contain credit prizes (paid regardless of line hits)
- Same spot hit = adds credit prize (not multiplier like Regal Riches)

**Progressive Jackpots (Free Games):**
| Jackpot | Diamonds Needed |
|---------|-----------------|
| Grand | 5 red |
| Major | 4 green |
| Minor | 3 blue |

**Card Building:**
- Great game for building free play offers
- Meters increment very slowly
- Can take earlier numbers based on promo value

**Free Check Method:**
- Bet pad does NOT show meters (unlike Regal Riches)
- More hassle to check
