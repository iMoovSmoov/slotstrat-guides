## How The Advantage Works

Samurai Dynasty features **persistent bonus symbols that move down**:

**Mechanic:**
- Bonus symbols move down one row each spin
- <strong>3</strong> bonus symbols anywhere → Free games bonus triggers
- Symbols persist until they exit bottom of reels

**Row Positions (3 rows):**
| Row | Position |
|-----|----------|
| Top | Just landed (3 spins to exit) |
| Middle | 2 spins to exit |
| Bottom | 1 spin to exit |

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: THREE SYMBOLS TRAP

**NEVER play if you see 3 bonus symbols:**
- Bonus was JUST triggered on last play
- All symbols will disappear next spin
- This is a common trap

---

## PLAY WHEN

| Setup | Action |
|-------|--------|
| <strong>1</strong> bonus symbol in TOP row | ✅ **Play** |
| <strong>2</strong> bonus symbols in MIDDLE row | ✅ **Play** |
| <strong>3</strong> bonus symbols visible | ❌ **NEVER** (trap) |

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- 3 bonus symbols visible (bonus just triggered)
- Only symbols in bottom row (about to exit)
- Symbols too spread out to realistically trigger

---

## STOP WHEN

- Free games bonus triggers

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Playing when 3 symbols are visible (they disappear)
- Not checking symbol row positions
- Expecting consistent bonus payouts (feast or famine)

---
