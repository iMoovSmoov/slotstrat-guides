## How The Advantage Works

Red Silk / Aztec Chief features **coin collection for wild reels**:

**Mechanic:**
- Coin holders above each reel
- <strong>2</strong> coins collected → Reel turns wild for <strong>2</strong> spins
- Active wilds have glowing gold border
- Coins in holder show spins remaining

**Key Difference from Golden Egypt:**
- More payout in progressives/jackpot pick bonus
- Line hits with coins less lucrative
- **Play TIGHTER than Golden Egypt**

---

## ⚠️ NOT LIKE GOLDEN EGYPT

**This game requires active wilds, NOT just coins:**
- Playing 2 coins in first 3 reels = NOT +EV
- Playing 1 coin in each of first 3 reels = NOT +EV
- Data from hundreds of sessions confirms this
- Other experienced APs agree

---

## PLAY WHEN

**Primary Requirement:**
- Active wilds (gold border + coins showing) in first <strong>3</strong> reels only

**Reel 4 Exception:**
- Active wild in reel 4 with <strong>2</strong> spins remaining
- AND <strong>2+</strong> coins already in first 3 reels
- Play <strong>1</strong> spin only to try for second wild reel
- Stop if no second coin lands

| Setup | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Active wild in reels 1-3 | ✅ **Play** |
| Reel 4 wild (2 spins) + 2 coins in reels 1-3 | ✅ **1 spin test** |
| Coins only (no active wilds) | ❌ Skip |
| Reels 4-5 wilds only | ❌ Skip |

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Only coins without active wilds (gold borders)
- Active wilds only in reels 4-5
- Treating this like Golden Egypt (common mistake)

---

## STOP WHEN

- Wild spins deplete (coin holders empty)
- Test spin fails to land second coin (reel 4 exception)

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Playing like Golden Egypt (coins only, no active wilds)
- Thinking lanterns/masks display matters (it doesn't)
- Playing single coins hoping to trigger wilds
- Not recognizing difference from Golden Egypt

---

## Additional Notes

**Lanterns/Masks Are Decorative:**
- Display above reels is for show
- Jackpot bonus NOT more likely with more revealed

**Free Check Method:**
- Tap bet level on main touchscreen
- No money required

**Game Variant Differences:**
| Feature | Red Silk | Aztec Chief |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Bet level reset | Returns to 75 credits after few minutes | Stays on last checked level |
| Hustling ease | Harder (resets) | Easier (can leave on 750 to track plays) |

**RTP Range:**
- 86% to 95%
