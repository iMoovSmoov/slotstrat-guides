## How The Advantage Works

Bubble Mania (Potion Pays / Hai Long / Fizzy Frenzy) features **persistent bubbles** with credit values:

**Mechanic:**
- Bubbles with credit values appear on reels
- Each spin → Bubbles move **up one row**
- Bubble lands on special symbol → Win credit value
- Bubbles can be triggered **multiple times** (don't disappear)

---

## PLAY WHEN (ANY ONE)

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Do NOT count bubbles on top row—they leave next spin.

**Option A — Total Value:**
- Total bubble credit value ≥ <strong>5x</strong> bet size
- Example: $3.75 bet → Need $18.75+ in bubble values

**Option B — Giant Bubbles:**
- Any giant bubble (2+ reels wide)
- Play regardless of credit value
- Giant bubbles = 2, 3, or 4 reels wide

**Option C — Hidden Bubbles:**
- Bubbles visible below bottom row
- Credit value obscured → Play anyway to see value

**Bubble Position Check:**
| Row | Counts Toward Total? |
|-----|---------------------|
| Top row | ❌ No (exits next spin) |
| Middle rows | ✅ Yes |
| Bottom row | ✅ Yes |
| Below bottom | ✅ Yes (check for incoming) |

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Total bubble value below <strong>5x</strong> bet (no giant bubbles)
- Only bubbles on top row
- No bubbles visible

---

## STOP WHEN

- All bubbles move off top of screen
- No valuable bubbles remaining below bottom row

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Counting top row bubbles (they're gone next spin)
- Not checking below bottom row for incoming bubbles
- Missing giant bubbles (always play regardless of value)
- Not using free check method (tap bet level)
