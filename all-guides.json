    "fullContent": "## Thumbnail\n\n![Hero](/images/default-hero.png)\n\n## This Is a Free Demo Guide\n\n> **Full access unlocks 111+ machine-specific guides** — each one built like this page, with real entry triggers, exit rules, and field-tested strategy notes. This demo shows you exactly what you get.\n\nEvery SlotStrat guide follows the same proven structure so you can make fast, confident decisions on the casino floor. Here is what each section means and why it matters.\n\n---\n\n## How The Advantage Works\n\nMust-Hit-By (MHB) progressives are the most beginner-friendly advantage play category because the math is straightforward:\n\n- The jackpot **must** trigger before reaching a posted ceiling (e.g. $200)\n- As the meter climbs closer to that ceiling, the **expected value (EV) of each spin increases**\n- At a high enough meter value, the EV flips positive — meaning the jackpot payout exceeds the expected cost to trigger it\n\n**Why this matters:**\n- Previous players have already funded most of the jackpot with their losses\n- You step in near the ceiling and capture the final payout at a fraction of the total cost\n- The ceiling is a **hard guarantee** — the jackpot cannot exceed it\n\n**Example:**\n- Minor jackpot must hit by $200, currently at $185\n- At most $15 of play remains before it MUST trigger\n- If your expected spin cost is $0.25, that is roughly 60 spins maximum\n- 60 spins x $0.25 = $15 max cost for a $185+ payout\n\nThis is the core principle behind every MHB guide in the library.\n\n---\n\n## Understanding the \"Play When\" Section\n\nThe **Play When** triggers are the most important part of every guide. They tell you the exact conditions that must be true before you sit down and play.\n\n**What to look for in real guides:**\n- Specific meter thresholds (dollar amounts or percentages of the ceiling)\n- Which jackpot tier matters (Minor, Major, or both)\n- Denomination-specific instructions (some meters only apply at certain bet levels)\n- Version-specific notes (some machines have multiple cabinet versions)\n\n**In this demo, the Play When triggers are:**\n\n<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>\n- Minor jackpot at **90%+** of its Must-Hit-By ceiling\n- Major jackpot at **90%+** of its ceiling\n- Check ALL bet levels using the denomination menu — each has its own independent meter\n\n**Why 90%?** This is a conservative threshold that balances profitability with availability. More aggressive players might enter at 85%, but 90% gives beginners a wider margin of safety.\n\n---\n\n## Understanding the \"Stop When\" Section\n\n**Stop When** rules protect your bankroll. They tell you exactly when to walk away — no guessing, no chasing.\n\n**The three types of stop rules you will see across guides:**\n1. **Trigger stop** — The feature or jackpot hit. The advantage is gone. Leave immediately.\n2. **Session stop-loss** — You have spent your budgeted spins without triggering. Walk away and check back later.\n3. **Bankroll floor** — Your total session funds dropped below a safe threshold.\n\n**In this demo, the Stop When rules are:**\n- Jackpot triggers and meter resets to seed → The advantage is gone. Walk away.\n- 60 spins without a hit → Your session budget is spent. Move on.\n- Bankroll below 30x bet → Not enough runway to play safely.\n\n**The discipline to stop is what separates advantage players from gamblers.**\n\n---\n\n## PLAY WHEN\n\n<strong>Meter Requirements:</strong>\n- Minor jackpot at **90%+** of Must-Hit-By ceiling\n- Major jackpot at **90%+** of Must-Hit-By ceiling\n\n<strong>Denomination Check:</strong>\n- Open the bet-level menu to cycle through all available denominations\n- Each denomination has its **own independent meter**\n- A $0.25 denom may be at 95% while $1.00 is only at 60%\n\n<strong>Best-Case Setup:</strong>\n- Both Minor AND Major elevated above 90%\n- Lowest available denomination (reduces cost per spin)\n\n---\n\n## DO NOT PLAY WHEN\n\n- Any meter below **85%** of its ceiling — not enough edge\n- You cannot verify the Must-Hit-By ceiling on the machine's help screen\n- Another player is already seated (never hover or pressure other players)\n- You are on tilt or chasing a loss from a previous session\n\n---\n\n## STOP WHEN\n\n- Must-Hit-By jackpot triggers and meter resets to seed value\n- **60 spins** without a jackpot hit (session stop-loss)\n- Bankroll drops below **30x** your current bet\n- You feel frustrated, rushed, or impulsive — walk away every time\n\n---\n\n## Denominations and Bet Sizing\n\n| Denomination | Min Bet | Recommended Bankroll | Notes |\n|:-------------|:--------|:---------------------|:------|\n| $0.01 (penny) | $0.25 | $15–$25 per session | Best for beginners; lowest variance |\n| $0.02 | $0.50 | $25–$40 per session | Good balance of cost and speed |\n| $0.05 | $1.00 | $50–$75 per session | Faster play; higher meter contribution |\n| $0.25 | $2.00 | $100+ per session | Advanced players only |\n\n**Tip:** Always start at the **lowest denomination** available. Check every bet level — the highest-percentage meter is your best play regardless of denom.\n\n---\n\n## COMMON MISTAKES\n\n- **Playing meters below 85%** — The math does not support it. Be patient.\n- **Ignoring the denomination menu** — The best play might be on a bet level you did not check.\n- **Staying after the jackpot triggers** — The meter resets. The edge is gone. Leave.\n- **Chasing with larger bets** — Bet size does not change when the jackpot triggers. Stay disciplined.\n- **Not setting a session stop-loss** — Without a hard stop, losses compound. Decide your limit before you sit down.\n- **Hovering over other players** — This is against casino etiquette and can get you flagged by staff.\n\n---\n\n## What Makes a SlotStrat Guide Different\n\nEvery guide in the full library includes:\n\n1. **Exact Play When triggers** — Machine-specific thresholds verified through field testing\n2. **Exact Stop When rules** — Clear exit conditions so you never have to guess\n3. **Denomination breakdowns** — Which bet levels to check and which to skip\n4. **Reference screenshots** — Photos of the actual machine so you can identify it on the floor\n5. **Common mistakes** — Traps that catch even experienced players\n6. **Advanced strategy notes** — Edge cases, version differences, and bankroll guidance\n\n**This demo shows the structure. Real guides fill every section with machine-specific data.**\n\n---\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n**How to Check Meters (Free):**\n1. Insert a $1 bill or small ticket\n2. Use the denomination or bet-level menu to cycle through all options\n3. Note the meter value and ceiling for each level\n4.

I have a good chance of hitting the bonus again on this next spin.\n\n### Image 5\n\n![FAT FORTUNES](images/fat-fortunes-5.jpg)\n\n**Description:** This was a nice 78x win in the bonus feature.\n\n### Image 6\n\n![FAT FORTUNES](images/fat-fortunes-6.jpg)\n\n**Description:** The bonus feature can be fairly volatile—this win was only 21x.\n\n### Image 7\n\n![FAT FORTUNES](images/fat-fortunes-7.jpg)\n\n**Description:** Notice the glimmer on the fish in the fifth reel—that indicates it is persistent and will move down one position next spin.\n\n### Image 8\n\n![FAT FORTUNES](images/fat-fortunes-8.jpg)\n\n### Image 9\n\n![FAT FORTUNES](images/fat-fortunes-9.jpg)\n\n**Description:** This is an even better play—there will be four persistent fish in play on the next spin.\n\n### Image 10\n\n![FAT FORTUNES](images/fat-fortunes-10.jpg)\n\n**Description:** This was a nice line hit, thanks to the wild penguin symbols that add a 2x multiplier to all wins.\n\n### Image 11\n\n![FAT FORTUNES](images/fat-fortunes-11.jpg)\n\n**Description:** You can get pretty good bonus wins, even on small bets.\n\n## How The Advantage Works\n\nFat Fortunes (Fat Cat / Puffy Penguin / Jelly Jams) features **persistent fish with shiny indicator**:\n\n**Mechanic:**\n- <strong>6</strong> fish symbols → Triggers bonus\n- Fish on reels → Disappear next spin\n- Fish above reels → PERSISTENT, move down one position per spin\n\n**The Secret (How to Identify Persistent Fish):**\n- Wait a few seconds\n- Persistent fish display **shining/gleaming animation**\n- Non-shiny fish = NOT persistent (disappear next spin)\n\n---\n\n## PLAY WHEN (EITHER)\n\n**Option A — Fish Above Reels:**\n- <strong>2</strong> fish symbols above the reels\n- (Always excellent play—fish often come in stacks)\n\n**Option B — Persistent Fish Count:**\n- <strong>3+</strong> persistent fish on reels (shiny animation)\n- Do NOT count: bottom row fish OR non-shiny fish\n\n| Setup | Action |\n|-------|--------|\n| 2 fish above reels | ✅ **Play** (excellent) |\n| 3+ shiny fish (not bottom row) | ✅ **Play** |\n| Only non-shiny fish | ❌ Skip |\n| Only bottom row fish | ❌ Skip |\n\n---\n\n## DO NOT PLAY WHEN\n\n- Fewer than <strong>2</strong> fish above reels\n- Fewer than <strong>3</strong> persistent (shiny) fish\n- Fish only on bottom row\n- Fish without shiny animation\n\n---\n\n## STOP WHEN\n\n- Bonus triggers (6 fish landed)\n\n---\n\n## COMMON MISTAKES\n\n- Not waiting for shiny animation to identify persistent fish\n- Counting non-shiny fish as persistent\n- Counting bottom row fish (they disappear)\n- Revealing this knowledge to other hustlers\n\n---\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n**Under-the-Radar Game:**\n- Most APs don't know about this\n- Check only when no other hustlers nearby\n- Others who don't know the shiny trick often give up\n\n**Fish Limits:**\n- Max <strong>2</strong> fish can appear above reels at once\n- Max <strong>4</strong> persistent fish on reels at one time\n- Need at least <strong>2</strong> regular fish + persistent fish for bonus\n\n**Different from Kraken Unleashed:**\n- All 6 symbols CAN'T come from above\n- Must land some regular fish on reels\n\n**Orange Fish (Credit Prizes/Jackpots):**\n- Can also be persistent\n- Will shine like regular persistent fish\n\n**Wild Symbol:**\n- Penguin/Cat face = Wild + <strong>2x</strong> multiplier on all wins\n\n**Jelly Jams Theme:**\n- Uses strawberries instead of fish\n- Same shiny trick likely applies\n\n**Check All Denominations:**\n- Multiple bet levels available\n- Check each for plays\n\n**Game Variants:**\n- Fat Cat ✅\n- Puffy Penguin ✅\n- Jelly Jams ✅ (same strategy)"

I would skip this play unless I knew I was on a higher RTP or if I was trying to build points.\n\n### Image 8\n\n![Lucky Pick: Bumble Bee / Cash Tree / Leprechaun](images/lucky-pick-bumble-bee--cash-tree--leprechaun-8.jpg)\n\n### Image 9\n\n![Lucky Pick: Bumble Bee / Cash Tree / Leprechaun](images/lucky-pick-bumble-bee--cash-tree--leprechaun-9.jpg)\n\n**Description:** We know we are on board D here because there are 10 credit picks revealed.

Red won on the previous game and the entire board will clear out next spin.\n\n### Image 4\n\n![Tic Tac Go](images/tic-tac-go-4.jpg)\n\n### Image 5\n\n![Tic Tac Go](images/tic-tac-go-5.jpg)\n\n**Description:** This is a much better play because the total equity here is 28x.\n\n### Image 6\n\n![Tic Tac Go](images/tic-tac-go-6.jpg)\n\n**Description:** This is an excellent play with both the major and minor jackpots on the board.\n\n### Image 7\n\n![Tic Tac Go](images/tic-tac-go-7.jpg)\n\n## How The Advantage Works\n\nTic Tac Go features **a tic-tac-toe board with accumulated prizes**:\n\n**Mechanic:**\n- 3x3 reelset with 3x3 tic-tac-toe board above\n- Red X's and blue O's land on reels → Move to board\n- X's/O's contain prizes (1x-10x bet) or jackpots\n- 3 in a row → Win ALL prizes of that color (not just the row)\n- Draw → Color with most symbols wins\n\n**Prize Range:**\n- Credit prizes: 1x to 10x bet size\n- Jackpots: Minor, Major, Mega\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ COMMON AP TRAP\n\n**Most APs play too aggressively and get wrecked:**\n- Nearly-full boards are tempting but NOT profitable\n- X's/O's harder to land as board fills (fewer spots)\n- Base game has huge drain\n- Need exceptionally large values to be profitable\n\n---\n\n## PLAY WHEN\n\n**Primary Requirement:**\n- Total X + O values ≥ <strong>27x</strong> bet size\n- Add ALL prizes on the board\n\n**Rocket Rollup Version:**\n- Use bet pad amount (NOT main screen)\n- Main screen includes progressive contribution\n- Example: $0.75 bet pad → Entry point = $20.25 (27x)\n\n| Setup | Action |\n|-------|--------|\n| Total board value ≥ 27x bet | ✅ **Play** |\n| Full board (9 filled) | ❌ Skip (resets next spin) |\n| 3 in a row showing | ❌ Skip (resets next spin) |\n\n---\n\n## DO NOT PLAY WHEN\n\n- Full board (all 9 positions filled) - resets next spin\n- 3 in a row already showing - resets next spin\n- Total value below 27x threshold\n- Large values concentrated on blocked/losing color\n\n---\n\n## STOP WHEN\n\n- Tic-tac-toe game won (3 in a row or draw)\n- Board resets next spin\n\n---\n\n## COMMON MISTAKES\n\n- Playing nearly-full boards (seems good, usually loses)\n- Not adding ALL values (both X's and O's)\n- Playing when 3 in a row already exists (will reset)\n- Using main screen bet amount on Rocket Rollup version\n- Ignoring blocked color situations\n\n---\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n**Blocked Colors:**\n- Some setups make one color impossible to win\n- Don't play if large values are on blocked color\n- Play more aggressively if large values guaranteed to win\n\n**Go Symbol:**\n- Lands in center of reels\n- Awards ALL prizes (both X's and O's) immediately\n\n**Major Jackpot:**\n- Appears fairly frequently\n- Usually ~50/50 shot of hitting when found\n\n**Spot Mechanics:**\n- X's/O's can't land in same spot twice\n- Filled board position = Can't land in corresponding reel position\n\n**Free Games:**\n- Triggers fairly frequently\n- Collected X's/O's do NOT transfer in or out\n\n**Rocket Rollup Version:**\n- Play same strategy, ignore progressives\n- Small loss percentage, evens out over time\n\n**Free Check Method:**\n- Tap menu icon in lower left\n- Use up/down arrows to cycle bet levels\n\n**RTP Range:**\n- 85% to 96%"

Ideally, you want to hit two wild features at once.\n\n## How The Advantage Works\n\nWish Mistress features **gem collection** that triggers wild features:\n\n**Mechanic:**\n- Collect blue, red, and yellow gems\n- <strong>4</strong> gems of single color → Activates wilds feature\n- Goal: Trigger 2 colors simultaneously for good payout\n\n**Gem Value Hierarchy:**\n| Color | Wild Type | Value |\n|-------|-----------|-------|\n| Blue | Full reel wilds | Best |\n| Yellow | Surrounding wilds | Medium |\n| Red | Random position wilds | Worst |\n\n---\n\n## PLAY WHEN (ANY ONE)\n\n**Option A — Double Trigger Setup:**\n- <strong>2</strong> meters at <strong>3</strong> gems each\n- (One gem away from double trigger)\n\n**Option B — Blue + Yellow Focus:**\n- <strong>5+</strong> combined blue and yellow gems\n- (Prioritize blue over yellow, avoid red-heavy)\n\n| Gems | Blue+Yellow | Action |\n|------|-------------|--------|\n| 3+3 (two meters) | Any | ✅ **Play** |\n| Any | 5+ | ✅ **Play** |\n| Single meter at 3 | Below 5 | ❌ Skip |\n\n---\n\n## DO NOT PLAY WHEN\n\n- Only one meter at 3 gems\n- Red-heavy gem distribution\n- Combined blue + yellow below <strong>5</strong>\n\n---\n\n## STOP WHEN\n\n- Wild feature triggers\n- Gem meter(s) reset to zero\n\n---\n\n## COMMON MISTAKES\n\n- Playing single color at 3 gems (usually doesn't pay well)\n- Prioritizing red gems (least lucrative)\n- Not recognizing double trigger potential\n\n---\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n**Double Trigger Strategy:**\n- Single wild feature = Usually poor payout\n- Two features at once = Good payout\n- Aim for 3-3 setup or 5+ blue/yellow combined\n\n**Gem Priority:**\n1. Blue (full reel wilds) — Best\n2. Yellow (surrounding wilds) — Medium\n3.

Scroll down to see the results of this attempt.\n\n### Image 3\n\n![ZODIAC LION / ZODIAC DRAGON](images/zodiac-lion--zodiac-dragon-3.jpg)\n\n### Image 4\n\n![ZODIAC LION / ZODIAC DRAGON](images/zodiac-lion--zodiac-dragon-4.jpg)\n\n**Description:** I would definitely still play this, but having holes in the middle like this really cut into the payout.\n\n### Image 5\n\n![ZODIAC LION / ZODIAC DRAGON](images/zodiac-lion--zodiac-dragon-5.jpg)\n\n**Description:** I considered playing this but decided to pass. If there was one more gold frame connecting horizontally on either the top or bottom clump, then I would play.\n\n### Image 6\n\n![ZODIAC LION / ZODIAC DRAGON](images/zodiac-lion--zodiac-dragon-6.jpg)\n\n**Description:** Avoid plays like this where the gold frames are concentrated in reels three, four and five.\n\n### Image 7\n\n![ZODIAC LION / ZODIAC DRAGON](images/zodiac-lion--zodiac-dragon-7.jpg)\n\n**Description:** Watch for plays like this that are the result of the previous player cashing out after the Lion Spin Bonus. Scroll down to see what the next spin will look like.\n\n### Image 8\n\n![ZODIAC LION / ZODIAC DRAGON](images/zodiac-lion--zodiac-dragon-8.jpg)\n\n**Description:** The leftover lion heads from the Lion Spin Bonus are now gold frames.\n\n### Image 9\n\n![ZODIAC LION / ZODIAC DRAGON](images/zodiac-lion--zodiac-dragon-9.jpg)\n\n### Image 10\n\n![ZODIAC LION / ZODIAC DRAGON](images/zodiac-lion--zodiac-dragon-10.jpg)\n\n**Description:** Zodiac Dragon isn’t nearly as common as Zodiac Lion, but it plays exactly the same.\n\n## How The Advantage Works\n\nZodiac Lion / Zodiac Dragon features **persistent gold frames**:\n\n**Mechanic:**\n- Lion/dragon head lands → Creates gold frame\n- Another head lands IN any frame → All connected frames turn WILD\n- Frames disappear next spin after triggered\n- Goal: 4-of-a-kind or 5-of-a-kind line hits (3-of-a-kind pays poorly)\n\n---\n\n## PLAY WHEN (ANY ONE)\n\n**Option A — Four Horizontal Frames:**\n- <strong>4+</strong> gold frames connected horizontally\n- Must span reels 1-4 OR reels 2-5\n\n**Option B — Three Horizontal + Large Clump:**\n- <strong>3+</strong> horizontal frames starting in reel 1 or 2\n- <strong>8+</strong> total connected frames in that clump\n\n| Horizontal Span | Total Clump | Action |\n|-----------------|-------------|--------|\n| Reels 1-4 | Any | ✅ **Play** |\n| Reels 2-5 | Any | ✅ **Play** |\n| Reels 1-3 or 2-4 | 8+ | ✅ **Play** |\n| Reels 3-5 only | Any | ❌ Skip |\n\n---\n\n## DO NOT PLAY WHEN\n\n- Frames only in reels 3-4-5 (no connection to reels 1-2)\n- Frames connected vertically but not horizontally\n- Random scattered frames not connected horizontally\n\n---\n\n## STOP WHEN\n\n- Lion/dragon head lands in gold frame\n- All connected frames turn wild\n- Frames disappear next spin\n\n---\n\n## COMMON MISTAKES\n\n- Playing any bunch of frames regardless of position (common mistake)\n- Playing reels 3-4-5 clumps with no connection to left reels\n- Expecting 3-of-a-kind to pay well (need 4+ of a kind)\n- Not recognizing horizontal vs vertical connections matter\n\n---\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n**Popular But Poorly Played:**\n- One of most popular AP games\n- Most hustlers play incorrectly (any frames = play)\n- Horizontal connection matters more than frame count\n\n**Lion Spin Bonus Leftovers:**\n- After Lion Spin Bonus → Leftover lion heads become frames next spin\n- Watch for players cashing out after bonus\n- These can be excellent walk-up plays\n\n**Bet Level Strategy:**\n- Top row bets (no Zodiac Wheel): Pay better but harder to land heads\n- Bottom row bets: Take more chances connecting clumps (wheel can help)\n- Even $0.60 bet pays well on 5-of-a-kind wilds\n\n**Game Variants:**\n- Zodiac Lion ✅ (common)\n- Zodiac Dragon ✅ (plays exactly the same, less common)\n\n**Pro Tip:** Turn down volume before checking\n\n**RTP:** 85% to 96%"
