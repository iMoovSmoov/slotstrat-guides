## How The Advantage Works

Diamond Tide Jungle features **persistent yellow wilds that shift left**:

**Mechanic:**
- Yellow wilds shift one position LEFT every spin
- When wild reaches reel 1 → Shifts off screen next spin
- Upcoming wilds appear right of reel 5 (marked "W")

**Wild Types:**
| Wild Type | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| Yellow | Persistent, shifts left each spin |
| Blue | NOT persistent, disappears next spin |

---

## PLAY WHEN (ANY ONE)

**Option A — Row Setup:**
- <strong>2+</strong> yellow wilds in SAME row
- Adjacent OR with <strong>1</strong> gap between them

**Option B — High Wild Count:**
- <strong>6+</strong> yellow wilds total (any position)

**Counting Rules:**
| Wild Location | Count It? |
|---------------|-----------|
| Reels 2-5 | ✅ Yes |
| Reel 1 | ❌ No (leaves next spin) |
| Blue wilds | ❌ No (disappear next spin) |
| Right of reel 5 ("W") | ✅ Yes (upcoming) |

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Fewer than <strong>2</strong> yellow wilds in same row (not aligned)
- Fewer than <strong>6</strong> total yellow wilds
- Only blue wilds present
- Only reel 1 wilds remain

---

## STOP WHEN

- All yellow wilds shift off screen (left side)

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Counting reel 1 wilds (they leave next spin)
- Counting blue wilds (they disappear next spin)
- Not checking right of reel 5 for upcoming wilds
- Expecting 3-of-a-kind to pay well (need 4+ for decent payout)

---

## Additional Notes

**Feast or Famine Game:**
- Wilds come out in clumps
- More yellow wilds = Higher chance of blue wild shower
- Can play any upcoming wilds to see if more appear

**Blue Wilds:**
- Shoot down from giant blue diamond above reels
- NOT persistent (disappear next spin)
- Triggered more often when many yellow wilds present

**Wild Appearance:**
- Don't always originate from right of reel 5
- Sometimes appear randomly on reels
- Often in big clumps

**Line Hit Quality:**
- 3-of-a-kind payouts are terrible
- Need <strong>4-of-a-kind minimum</strong> for decent payout
