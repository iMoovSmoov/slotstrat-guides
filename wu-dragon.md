## How The Advantage Works

Wu Dragon / Star Goddess features **persistent frames** with fireball mechanic:

**Mechanic:**
- Frames lock onto reels
- Fireball shoots from upper right occasionally
- Fireball hits frame → That frame + all other frames turn WILD
- Fireball also turns adjacent symbols wild (3 above, 3 below, 1 each side)
- Frames disappear next spin after triggered

**Goal:** 5-of-a-kind line hits (4-of-a-kind pays poorly, 3-of-a-kind barely pays)

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Only check **BOTTOM row bets** (Portal Lock feature). Top row frames are NOT persistent.

---

## PLAY WHEN (ANY ONE)

**Option A — Seven Frames:**
- <strong>7+</strong> frames in first four reels
- WITH <strong>5+</strong> frames in reels 2-3

**Option B — Six Frames + Horizontal:**
- <strong>6+</strong> frames in first four reels
- WITH <strong>3+</strong> frames connected horizontally

**Option C — Full Row:**
- <strong>4+</strong> frames in same row
- (Don't need to be connected)

| Frames in R1-4 | Reels 2-3 | Horizontal | Action |
|----------------|-----------|------------|--------|
| 7+ | 5+ | Any | ✅ **Play** |
| 6+ | Any | 3+ | ✅ **Play** |
| 4+ same row | Any | N/A | ✅ **Play** |

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Checking top row bets (frames not persistent)
- Frames concentrated on right side only
- Frames only in reel 1 (can't expand left)
- Fewer than 6 frames with poor distribution

---

## STOP WHEN

- Fireball hits frame
- All frames turn wild
- Frames disappear next spin

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Checking top row bets (frames NOT persistent—only Portal Lock)
- Not understanding fireball expansion mechanic
- Expecting 3-of-a-kind or 4-of-a-kind to pay well
- Playing reel 1 heavy boards (fireball can't expand left)

---

## Additional Notes

**Frame Value Hierarchy:**
1. Reels 2-3 (most valuable—full expansion room)
2. Middle rows (more expansion room)
3. Reel 4 (some value)
4. Reel 1 (least valuable—can't expand left)

**Anti-Vulturing Quirk:**
- Sometimes frames mysteriously disappear when checking
- Playing 1 spin (any bet level) restores them
- Exploit this to find hidden plays

**Fireball Behavior:**
- Lands frequently when frames present
- Multiple fireballs can hit multiple frames
- Cascade of wilds = Biggest wins
- Glowing border animation = Big win incoming

**Game Variants:**
- Wu Dragon ✅
- Star Goddess ✅ (same strategy)

**Portal Lock:**
- Only bottom row bets have persistent frames
- Top row bet frames disappear every spin
