## How The Advantage Works

Big Ocean Jackpots features **bubbles** that move up the reels:

**Mechanic:**
- Bubbles move **up one position** each spin
- Bubble lands on coin symbol → Prize awarded
- **Wild bubbles** trigger → All poker symbols turn wild
- 2 wild bubbles trigger same spin → <strong>2x</strong> multiplier on wild wins

**Bubble Types:**
| Type | Contains | Chase? |
|------|----------|--------|
| Wild | Wild symbol | ✅ Yes |
| Jackpot | Mini/Minor/Maxi | ❌ No |

## PLAY WHEN

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Do NOT count bubbles on top row—they exit next spin.

<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- <strong>3+</strong> wild bubbles anywhere except top row

**Why Wild Bubbles:**
- Reel position doesn't matter
- Value comes from poker symbols turning wild after trigger
- Creates cascade of wild wins

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Wild bubbles only on top row
- Fewer than <strong>3</strong> wild bubbles
- Only jackpot bubbles present (no advantage)
- Chasing maxi jackpot bubbles (too difficult to hit)

---

## STOP WHEN

- Wild bubbles trigger (poker symbols turn wild)
- All wild bubbles move off top of screen

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Counting top row bubbles (they're gone next spin)
- Chasing jackpot bubbles (mini/minor/maxi are common, no advantage)
- Chasing maxi bubbles alone (too hard to trigger)
- Confusing wild bubbles with jackpot bubbles

---

## Additional Notes

**Wild Bubble Effect:**
- Triggers on coin symbol
- All poker symbols (♠️♣️♥️♦️) turn wild
- Purple spade, green club, red heart, yellow diamond

**Larger Jackpots:**
- Major/Royal/Mega/Grand require multiple jackpot bubbles same spin
- Grand = Octopus (minor) + Shark (maxi) + Pufferfish (mini) simultaneously
- NOT worth chasing

**Jackpot Bubbles:**
- Super common
- Offer NO advantage
- Don't waste time tracking them
