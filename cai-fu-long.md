## How The Advantage Works

Cai Fu Long features **coin collection** that turns wild or triggers hold & spin:

**Mechanic:**
- Coins land and lock for <strong>3</strong> spins
- New coin lands → Counter resets to <strong>3</strong>
- <strong>6</strong> coins collected → Hold & spin feature
- Fewer than 6 coins → **Coins turn wild on final spin**

---

## ⚠️ PREREQUISITE CHECK

**MUST show "1+ spin left" above reels before playing.**

---

## PLAY WHEN

**BONUS BOOST Bets** (labeled on bet pad):

| Coins | Requirement | Action |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | — | ❌ Never play |
| 2 | At least 1 coin in reels 1–3 | ✅ Play |
| 3+ | — | ✅ Always play |

**NON-BONUS BOOST Bets** (labeled on bet pad):

| Coins | Requirement | Action |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | — | ❌ Never play |
| 2 | 2 coins in reels 1–3, **different reels** | ✅ Play |
| 3 | At least 1 coin in reels 1–3 | ✅ Play |
| 4+ | — | ✅ Always play |

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Shows "0 spins left" above reels
- Only 1 coin locked
- 2 coins but none in reels 1–3 (Bonus Boost)
- 2 coins in same reel within reels 1–3 (Non-Boost)

---

## STOP WHEN

- Coins turn wild on final spin
- Hold & spin feature completes (if 6 coins triggered it)

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Not checking "spins left" counter above reels
- Playing 1-coin state (never +EV)
- Confusing Bonus Boost vs Non-Boost requirements
- Not noticing coin positions (reels 1–3 matter)

---

## Additional Notes

**Why Bonus Boost Plays More Aggressive:**
- Bonus Boost = 2x chance to trigger free spins
- But Non-Boost has better line hits and bonus payouts
- Net RTP likely same, so play Boost slightly more aggressive

**Dragon Feature:**
- Base game: Dragon may randomly add up to 15 coins
- Hold & spin: Dragon may add 1–2 coins

**Coins Turn Wild:**
- Only if hold & spin NOT triggered on final spin
- Sometimes triggering hold & spin costs potential line hits

**vs. Aztec Adventures / Wu Wu Coins:**
- Cai Fu Long: Coins **always** turn wild on final spin
- Aztec/Wu Wu: Coins only turn wild if pyramid symbol lands
- Cai Fu Long has different coin frequency per reel based on locked coins
