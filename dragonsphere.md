## How The Advantage Works

DragonSphere features **wild spheres that move DOWN**:

**Mechanic:**
- Wild spheres move DOWN one row every spin
- Wild lands on dragon symbol → ALL surrounding symbols turn wild
- Expansion: 3 spaces above, 3 below, 1 on each side (if room)

**Important:**
- Spheres move DOWN (opposite of Ocean Magic)
- Bottom row = Gone next spin

---

## PLAY WHEN (ANY ONE)

**Option A — Reels 2-3 (Most Valuable):**
- Wild spheres in reels 2 or 3
- NOT on bottom row

**Option B — Reel 1:**
- Wild sphere above reel 1, OR
- Wild sphere in top row, OR
- Wild sphere in second-from-top row

**Option C — Reel 4:**
- Wild sphere above reel 4, OR
- Wild sphere in top row only

| Reel | Valid Positions | Action |
|------|-----------------|--------|
| Reel 1 | Above reel, top 2 rows | ✅ **Play** |
| Reel 2 | Anywhere except bottom | ✅ **Play** |
| Reel 3 | Anywhere except bottom | ✅ **Play** |
| Reel 4 | Above reel, top row only | ✅ **Play** |
| Any reel | Bottom row | ❌ Skip |

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Wild spheres only on bottom row
- No wild spheres visible (including above reels)

---

## STOP WHEN

- All wild spheres move off bottom of screen

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

- Playing bottom row spheres (gone next spin)
- Not checking ABOVE reels for incoming spheres
- Confusing with Ocean Magic (spheres move DOWN here, not up)
- Confusing expanded wilds with real spheres

---

## Additional Notes

**Why Reels 2-3 Are Best:**
- Room to expand on both sides when hitting dragon
- Massive win potential

**Checking Above Reels:**
- Spheres show up above reel ONE SPIN before entering
- Many hustlers overlook this = Good opportunity

**Spheres Come in Spurts:**
- Play top-row reel 4 wilds to see if more appear

**Massive Win Setup:**
- Wild sphere on dragon in reel 2 AND reel 4 or 5

**Distinguishing Real Spheres from Expanded Wilds:**
- After dragon hit, screen shows wilds everywhere
- Hard to tell which are real spheres
- **Trick:** Switch bet level and back → Expanded wilds disappear, real spheres remain
