## How The Advantage Works

Jackpot Catcher (Sun / Moon) features **glowing rings** that lock on reels:

**Mechanic:**
- Glowing rings lock on reels for <strong>3</strong> spins
- Credit value lands in ring → Win that amount
- 3 internal segments show spins remaining
- Sun/Moon in active ring → Refills AND upgrades multiplier

**Ring Values:**
| Ring Color | Multiplier | Point Value |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| Yellow | 1x | 1 |
| Green | 2x | 2 |
| Pink | 3x | 3 |
| Red | 5x | 5 |

---

## PLAY WHEN

<strong>Primary Requirement:</strong>
- Ring value total ≥ <strong>5</strong>

**Counting Examples:**
- 5 yellow rings = 5 points ✅
- 1 green (2) + 1 pink (3) = 5 points ✅
- 1 red (5) = 5 points ✅
- 2 green (4) + 1 yellow (1) = 5 points ✅

| Ring Total | Action |
|------------|--------|
| Below 5 | ❌ Walk away |
| 5+ | ✅ **Play** |

---

## DO NOT PLAY WHEN

- Ring value total below <strong>5</strong>
